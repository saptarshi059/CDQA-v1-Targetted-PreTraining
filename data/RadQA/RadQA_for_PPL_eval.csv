 AP CHEST 03:03 A.M. ON [**2129-12-27**]

 HISTORY:  Urosepsis.  Emphysema.  Atrial fibrillation."
1,"FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Preoperative assessment.

 The mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is
 increased opacity within the right lower lobe and also in a portion of the
 right middle lobe with associated volume loss, manifested by inferior and
 medial displacement of the major fissure.  There is some fluid extending into
 the major fissure.  The left lung is clear except for minimal discoid
 atelectasis at the left lung base and a possible small left pleural effusion."
2,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: 64 year old male with status post recent STE MI. Now with
 increasing edema and shortness of breath.

 AP supine single view of the chest is compared to [**2101-3-24**].

 FINDINGS: The heart is enlarged in size but stable in the interval.
 Mediastinal contour is unchanged. There is upper zone redistribution of the
 pulmonary artery vasculature. Perihilar haziness as well as diffuse bilateral
 pulmonary opacities. These findings are consistent with acute CHF. There are
 also bilateral pleural effusions. There is barium in the left colon from
 previous contrast study."
3,"IMPRESSION:

 1.  Interval decrease in adenopathy within the chest abdomen and pelvis.

 2.  Decreased splenomegaly, now 15 cm.

 3.  Progressive compression of the T11 and L2 vertebral bodies, likely
 osteoporotic."
4,"IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intra-abdominal process.
 2.  Fatty liver.
 3.  Status post presumed appendectomy."
5,"IMPRESSION:

 1) No pneumothorax.
 2) New small bilateral pleural effusions and mild bibasilar atelectasis."
6,IMPRESSION:  No obstruction or perforation.
7,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post chest tube removal.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.

 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained, compared with
 examination performed 2 days ago.

 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of both the right-sided IJ central
 venous catheter as well as the left-sided basilar chest tube.  NG tube has
 also been removed as has been the mediastinal drain.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.  There is bibasilar atelectasis, right worse than left, with
 associated left retrocardiac opacity, probably relating to atelectasis.  No
 significant pleural effusions are evident.  Note is made of a curvilinear
 radiopacity projecting over the left upper abdomen, probably within the
 stomach, and likely represents radiopaque medication or enteric contrast
 material within the stomach.  Sternotomy sutures appear intact.  Mediastinal
 clips are again seen."
8,"FINAL REPORT
 CHEST SINGLE AP FILM:

 HISTORY: ICD placement and shortness of breath.

 There is a right sided dual chamber ICD with leads unchanged in location in
 this single view compared with the prior film of [**2101-5-25**]. No pneumothorax.
 There is cardiomegaly with upper zone redistribution, bilateral pleural
 effusions and associated bibasilar atelectases. Consolidation at the lung
 bases cannot be ruled out."
9,"INDICATION:  30-year-old female pregnant with TTP-HUS and severe preeclampsia
 with low platelet count.  Requiring urgent plasmapheresis.

 OPERATORS:  Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 501**] (fellow) and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 731**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 63**] (attending).

 ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of
 fentanyl (25 cmcg) over the total intra-service time of 20 minutes during
 which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.

 PROCEDURE:  After risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the
 patient, written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to
 the angiography suite and placed supine on the table.  The right neck was
 prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  A pre-procedure timeout and
 huddle were performed per standard [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.  The patient was placed in
 left semi-lateral decubitus position (LPO-[**Doctor Last Name 14451**]).

 Under son[**Name (NI) 536**] guidance with hard copy images on file, the right internal
 jugular vein was cannulated with a 21-gauge micropuncture needle through which
 a 0.018 wire was advanced into the superior vena cava.  The needle was
 exchanged for a micropuncture sheath.  The inner dilator and wire were removed
 and a short [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire was advanced into the inferior vena cava.  Over the
 wire, sequential dilation was performed up to 14 French and the triple-lumen
 hemodialysis catheter (including VIP port) was advanced over the wire with tip
 terminating in the right atrium.  The wire was removed and the catheter
 aspirated and flushed easily.  A final fluoroscopic image of the chest was
 obtained from this location.  The catheter was sutured to the skin with 0 silk
 suture and capped and dressed appropriately.  There were no immediate
 complications."
10,"IMPRESSION:  Findings consistent with pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Findings may represent some interval worsening, also be due, at
 least in part, to change in patient positioning."
11,"FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  80-year-old female with pleural effusion.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2184-9-29**].

 TWO VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The large right perihilar opacity/effusion have
 nearly resolved, with only small residual right pleural fluid.  The right
 basilar pleural catheter is in unchanged position.  The aorta is tortuous and
 heavily calcified.  The bony thorax is markedly distorted by severe S-shaped
 scoliosis, and kyphosis, and degenerative change of the thoracic spine."

14,"FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  30-year-old female, 24 weeks pregnant with TTP, requiring
 placement of temporary triple-lumen pheresis line with VIP port.

 OPERATORS:  Procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 234**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 896**] (fellow).  Dr.
 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the attending radiologist, supervised and  reviewed the study.

 ANESTHESIA:  1% local lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the
 procedure were explained to the patient, informed consent was obtained. The
 potential risks of radiation in a pregnant patient were also reviewed and
 confirmed with the patient.  She was brought to the angiography suite and
 placed supine on the imaging table.  Her abdomen was shielded and the neck and
 indwelling right pheresis catheter were prepped and draped in the usual
 sterile fashion.  A pre-procedural timeout and huddle were performed per [**Hospital1 184**]
 protocol.  Under ultrasound guidance with hard copy images on file, a
 micropuncture set was used to access the left internal jugular vein and a
 0.018 wire was advanced into the SVC. This was subsequently exchanged for a
 0.035 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire. A 12 French x 16 cm pheresis catheter with VIP was selected
 and after sequential fascial dilatation, the catheter was placed over the wire
 with the tip positioned in the distal SVC.  The catheter was secured to the
 skin with 0 silk suture.  The catheter was flushed and aspirated well.  A
 final fluoroscopic spot image demonstrated good position of the catheter and
 no pneumothorax.

 The patient was then placed on a gurney and the indwelling right pheresis
 catheter was removed and hemostasis achieved with manual compression.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complication."

 INDICATION:  66-year-old woman with CLL and new PICC.  Additional views
 obtained for placement of PICC.

 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph from [**2170-5-17**].

 FINDINGS:  Oblique and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is a
 right PICC line with the tip in the right atrium.  There is otherwise no
 significant change from the prior radiograph.  There is no new parenchymal
 infiltrate, pneumothorax or pleural effusions. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable."
23,IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe infiltrate persists.
24,"INDICATION:  Right basal ganglia hemorrhage, evaluate change.

 COMPARISON:  [**2102-10-27**].

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:

 An intraparenchymal hematoma within the right basal ganglia is stable in size,
 currently measuring 38 x 26 mm, previously 39 x 27 mm.  Intraventricular
 extension is again noted into the adjacent lateral ventricle, with some
 redistribution of this intraventricular component now seen layering within the
 occipital horns.  There is no extension into the third or fourth ventricles.
 There is no new focus of intracranial hemorrhage identified.  The extent of
 vasogenic edema and associated mass effect is grossly stable from one day
 prior.  There is focal mass effect upon the right lateral ventricle, without
 significant shift of midline structures.  The ventricles are stable in size,
 without development of hydrocephalus.  The basal cisterns remain patent.
 Accounting for underlying chronic small vessel ischemic changes in the
 periventricular white matter, the [**Doctor Last Name 34**]-white matter differentiation is
 preserved.  There is no evidence of acute vascular territory infarction.

 The osseous structures demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous
 lesions.  Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are again clear."
25,"IMPRESSION: 1.  No definite change in bilateral perihilar infiltrates.

 ileocolonic anastomosis, without evidence of local recurrence.

 2.  Interval resolution of a few pulmonary nodules.  Few remaining sub-5-mm
 pulmonary nodules in both lungs are non-specific and are either unchanged or
 slightly smaller since the prior study.  Recommended followup chest CT in six
 months to assess interval change.

 3.  A stable 8-mm focus of enhancement within segment VII of the liver likely
 represents a flash-filling hemangioma or an FNH.

 4.  No evidence of new metastatic disease in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

 HISTORY:  74-year-old male with history of trauma.  Patient with known prior
 ICH.  Currently, patient with worsening mental status. Evaluation for interval
 change.

 COMPARISON:  Non-contrast head CT from [**2200-11-20**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain.  No
 contrast was administered.

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:

 Compared to the prior, there is new intraventricular hemorrhage seen in the
 occipital [**Doctor Last Name 218**] of the left lateral ventricle.  Additionally, the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 218**]
 of the left lateral ventricle measures 1.9 cm, which is slightly larger than
 prior (1.6 cm).

 Again seen is diffuse bifrontal subarachnoid hemorrhage which appears
 unchanged.  The intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left temporal lobe, left
 frontal lobe, right mid brain and pons, right thalamus, and left
 pontocerebellar angle appears grossly unchanged compared to prior.  The focus
 of subarachnoid hemorrhage seen in the right posterior frontal lobe appears
 unchanged. The right parafalcine subdural hematoma appears stable.

 Opacification of the maxillary sinuses, sphenoid sinuses and nasopharynx is
 improved compared to prior.  The mastoid air cells continue to be well
 aerated.  The left frontal bone and left temporal bone fractures are
 unchanged."

 subdural hematoma is slightly larger compared to prior study."
31,"FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  84-year-old male with mediastinal hematoma seen on outside hospital
 study.  Hypotension.

 No prior images available at this hospital.

 AP PORTABLE CHEST:  The mediastinal contours are markedly abnormal with
 bulging convexity of the aorticopulmonary window and widening of the aortic
 knob.  There is soft tissue density circumferentially surrounding the aortic
 arch, consistent with known aortic leak and mediastinal hematoma.  The trachea
 is deviated to the right by the enlarged aortic arch. There is no evidence of
 apical pleural capping. The lung parenchyma appears grossly clear, and there
 is no overt congestive failure. There is a left sided pleural effusion. There

 CT OF THE NECK WITH CONTRAST.

 INDICATION:  Hemiparesis and odontoid fracture.

 Helical images were obtained through the neck after dynamic intravenous
 contrast administration.  Correlation is made to the MRI examination of the
 spine from [**2109-1-5**].  There is evidence for spinal canal stenosis and
 posterocentral spurring with mild compression of the ventral aspect of the
 cord at C5-6 and C6-7 levels.  There is a type II fracture involving the dens
 with minimal rotational subluxation of C1 in relation to C2.  There is no
 compromise of the canal at the cervicomedullary junction.  No displacement of
 the odontoid process is seen on this examination.  No definite fractures could
 be identified involving the base of the skull.

 There are no soft-tissue mass lesions associated around the odontoid process.
 A few scattered nonspecific lymph nodes are seen within the posterior triangle
 of the neck bilaterally which measure less than 4 mm and are nonspecific in
 nature.  There is no adenopathy in the nasopharynx.  Limited images obtained
 through the upper chest were unremarkable.  A small infarct is again noted
 involving the left paracentral aspect of the pons which was presumably
 subacute in nature."

 PICC LINE PLACEMENT

 INDICATION:  IV access needed for IV fluids.

 The procedure was explained to the patient.  A timeout was performed.

 RADIOLOGIST:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 64**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**] performed the procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 65**],
 the Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a double lumen PICC line measuring 39 cm in length was then
 placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under
 fluoroscopic guidance.  Position of the catheter was confirmed by a
 fluoroscopic spot film of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications."

 PORTABLE HEAD ULTRASOUND

 HISTORY:  Preterm infant, now term equivalent post-menstrual age.

 Comparison is [**1-4**].

 Ventricles are normal in size and configuration.  There is no evidence for
 intraventricular, intraparenchymal, or extra-axial hemorrhage.  Extra-axial
 fluid spaces are normal.  Posterior fossa and midline structures are normal."
40,"FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON [**6-29**]

 HISTORY:  Abnormal outside chest radiograph:

 Prior chest radiographs are not provided for review.

 Horizontally oriented opacities in the right upper chest correspond to the
 costosternal junctions, although there could be lung lesions fortuitously
 distributed.  Nevertheless, the lateral view shows a nearly 2-cm wide round
 radiopacity projecting over the retrosternal lung which could be another or
 one of the same lung lesions, particularly the portion projecting over the
 right first anterior interspace.  Any other chest radiograph should be
 obtained for side-by-side comparison, supplemented by either oblique views or
 chest CT scanning.  There is no evidence of central adenopathy.  The heart is
 normal size and there is no pleural effusion."
41,"FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ON [**5-25**].

 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, status post upgraded ICD.

 FINDINGS:  Compared with [**2101-5-21**], moderate-sized bilateral, right greater than
 left pleural effusions persist.  There is persistent volume loss involving
 both lower lobes.  The perihilar infiltrates/pulmonary edema are probably not
 significantly changed, allowing for some motion artifacts on the right
 hemithorax."
42,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  66-year-old woman with CLL, recent viral pneumonia with new
 pulmonary nodule.

 COMPARISONS:  CT chest without contrast from [**2170-7-17**], CT torso with
 contrast from [**2170-6-28**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was obtained through the chest without the
 administration of intravenous contrast material and 5 and 1.25 mm axial slices
 coronal and sagittal reformats were completed.

 FINDINGS:  Thyroid gland is unremarkable.  There are no pathologically
 enlarged supraclavicular, axillary or mediastinal lymph nodes.  Small sub-5-mm
 mediastinal lymph nodes are present and similar in size and distribution to
 the prior study.  There are mild coronary artery calcifications.  Small
 pericardial effusion has slightly increased since the prior study which in an
 immunocompromised setting could be suggestive of pericarditis.  The airways
 are patent to the subsegmental levels.

 LUNGS:  Since the recent prior study, there has been significant improvement
 in multiple ground-glass opacities predominantly in the right upper lobe with
 only minimal ground-glass opacities persisting.  The nodule seen in the right
 lower lobe on the prior study measuring 6 mm is no longer identified on this
 exam.  However, there are multiple new nodules with surrounding halos since
 the prior study.  For example, 5-mm right lower lobe nodule (4:174), 3-mm left
 lower lobe nodule (4:144), 2 mm left lower lobe nodule (4:134), 4 mm lingular
 nodule (4:116) are new. In immunocompromise host, the new nodules with
 surrounding halos are concerning for fungal infection.  However, if patient is
 not immunocompromised, differential includes viral infection, new bacterial
 infection, COP or less likely vasculitis.  There is no definite focal
 consolidation or pleural effusion.

 This study is not tailored for evaluation of the subdiaphragmatic structures
 but shows multiple calcifications in the spleen, unchanged from prior exam.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Since the recent prior study from [**2170-7-17**] prior
 study, there is new slight wedging of the superior endplate of L2.  Since the
 CT torso from [**2170-6-28**], there is also new deformity of the superior
 endplate of T11.  There are no other concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions."

 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Surgical suture chains are seen within the right mid-
 to-upper lung.  Aside from minimal left basilar subsegmental atelectasis, the
 lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The
 heart is normal in size, with a mildly unfolded aorta.  Prominence of the
 right hilum is unchanged across multiple prior studies dating back to [**2-16**], [**2112**].  Cholecystectomy clips overlie the right upper quadrant of the

 COMPARISON:  CT spine from OSH from today.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  57-year-old man with intracranial hemorrhage, C2 fracture,
 question acute process in the chest.

 FINDINGS:  Two AP images of the chest were obtained portably with patient
 supine.  Comparison with a CT C-spine from same date from an outside hospital.
 The lungs appear essentially clear bilaterally without focal consolidation,
 effusion, or signs of CHF.  A skinfold projecting over the lateral margin of
 the left lung simulates a pneumothorax though no definite sign of pneumothorax
 is seen and there is no pneumothorax seen in the imaged lung apices on the CT
 C-spine from earlier today.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 unremarkable, though aorta is somewhat unfolded.  The imaged osseous
 structures appear intact."
47,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Screening.  No complaints today.

 SCREENING MAMMOGRAM:  Comparison is made with a prior [**Hospital1 51**] mammogram dated
 [**2174-12-21**].  The breast tissues are predominantly fatty.  There is no
 evidence of dominant or spiculated mass, suspicious clustered
 microcalcifications, nor architectural distortion.  The overall appearance is
 stable since the prior exam."
48,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: 51 year old woman status post repair of incarcerated hernia
 presents to rule out pneumothorax.

 COMPARISONS: None.

 Single frontal chest radiograph obtained in supine position shows no large
 pneumothorax.  However, the presence of a small pneumothorax cannot be
 excluded on this supine study.  An ETT is seen with tip at 2.5 cm above the
 carina.  An NGT has its tip below the diaphragm.  Areas of patchy subsegmental
 atelectasis are seen in bilateral lungs.  The presence of small pleural
 effusions cannot be rule out on this supine study."
49,"FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INFORMATION: Patient with history of pontine infarct now presenting
 with acute worsening and total plegia on the right for further evaluation.

 TECHNIQUE: T1 sagittal and axial, and FLAIR, T2 and susceptibility axial
 images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium. T1 axial images of the
 brain were also obtained following gadolinium. 3D time of flight MRA of the
 circle of [**Location (un) **] was acquired.

 FINDINGS

 BRAIN MRI:

 Comparison was made with the previous study of [**2109-1-5**].

 On the diffusion weighted images, there are two distinct infarct identified in
 the left pontine region with an infarct in the left cerebellar hemisphere.
 Since the previous study, the more anteriorly located pontine and left
 cerebellar infarcts are new.   No evidence of new infarct is seen in the
 supratentorial brain. There is no midline shift mass effect or hydrocephalus.
 Periventricular white matter changes are identified. No evidence of abnormal
 enhancement is seen following the administration of gadolinium.

 MRA OF THE HEAD:

 The 3D time of flight MRA of the head again demonstrates diffuse narrowing of
 the basilar artery with mid basilar stenosis and probable stenosis at the
 left vertebro-basilar junction. Right distal vertebral artery is not
 visualized. No significant interval change is seen on the MRA since the
 previous study."

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recently diagnosed multiple myeloma, in another institution,
 recurrent chylothorax, repeated right pleural aspirates positive for
 triglycerides.  Left pleural effusion not aspirated.  Evaluate for
 lymphadenopathy.  Background of right mastectomy, right chest radiation and
 thyroidectomy.  Mild chronic renal impairment.  Low serum calcium, elevated
 serum phosphate.

 TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric, multidetector CT acquisition of the chest was
 performed without intravenous or oral contrast.  Images are presented for
 display in the axial plane at 1.25- and 5-mm collimation.  A series of
 multiplanar reformation images are also submitted for review.

 FINDINGS:  No prior CT is available for comparison.
 The patient has had a right mastectomy.  The thyroid is absent.  Mixed lytic
 and sclerotic lesions of the sternum, both anterior first ribs, medial
 clavicles, and many of the thoracic vertebrae are extensive, there is
 associated soft tissue calcification anterior to the right sternoclavicular
 joint.  The thoracic spine is scoliotic.  Exuberant calcification of the
 thoracic and abdominal aorta, the innominate, left common carotid, and left
 subclavian artery origins, coronary arteries, and the right renal artery
 ostium is markedly severe.  A left pleural effusion is moderately large.  The
 right pleural effusion shown on the chest radiograph dated [**2184-8-3**] has
 completely resolved after chest drain insertion (2, 44), its side hole is
 within the pleural cavity.  Linear scarring in the medial aspect of the right
 upper lobe (2:14), most likely represents prior radiation therapy and
 subsequent cicatricial atelectasis.  Compressive atelectasis of the left lower
 lobe is moderately severe.  Ground glass attenuation of the left lung is of
 uncertain significance and could represent lymphatic obstruction, as the
 function of the moderately large left pleural effusion.  The airways are
 patent to the subsegmental level.
 The heart size is normal.  There is no pericardial effusion.  The upper
 esophagus is mildly dilated, which places patient at an increased risk of
 aspiration.  A focus of calcification in the azygoesophageal recess may
 represent calcified adenopathy.  This study is not tailored for evaluation of
 the upper abdomen, only to confirm normal-appearing adrenal glands and the
 absence of upper abdominal ascites."

 PROCEDURE:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to
 the patient, informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the
 angiography suite and laid in supine position.  The right neck was prepped and
 draped in standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout and huddle were
 performed.  The patient's right neck was examined with ultrasound,
 demonstrating a patent and compressible right internal jugular vein.  This
 vein was cannulated with a micropuncture needle just above the clavicles. Pre-
 and post-cannulation images were obtained and printed.  A guidewire was
 advanced into the SVC through the needle.  The needle was exchanged for a
 micropuncture sheath.  The inner dilator and wire were removed and exchanged
 for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 379**] wire, which was extended down into the upper right atrium.  The
 sheath was exchanged for a 14 French dilator. Following dilation, the 15 cm
 triple lumen dialysis/pheresis catheter including VIP port was advanced over
 the wire with tip terminating in the high right atrium. The wire was removed,
 the catheter flushed.  A post- procedure fluoroscopic image of the tip
 confirms the tip location in the high right atrium.  The catheter was secured
 to the skin with 0-0 silk suture and dressed appropriately.  There were no
 immediate complications."

 HISTORY:  Hypercalcemia and aplastic anemia.

 INTERPRETATION:  Whole body views of the skeleton were obtained, which show a
 focus of abnormally increased tracer activity, particularly on the posterior
 view, just superior to the left kidney.  In addition, a focus of increased
 tracer activity within the right foot is seen as well as at the right side of
 the cervical spine, likely relating to degenerative changes.

 SPECT images of the abdomen were then obtained.  These images showed that the
 region of increased tracer activity is superior and just posterior to the left
 kidney, in the expected location of the spleen.  On these images, a focus of
 increased tracer activity is also seen in the costochondral portion of a mid
 right thoracic rib, probably slight post-traumatic changes.

 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, and right
 internal jugular central venous line have been removed.  Mediastinal drain,
 and left-sided chest tubes remain in place.  Pneumomediastinum has nearly
 resolved.  There is a tiny left apical pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is mildly widened, an expected post-operative finding.  There is
 linear left basilar atelectasis."

 HISTORY:  GBS, for interval change.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-1**], there is increasing
 opacification at the right base medially with residual opacification of the

 pneumonia.  Monitoring and support devices are in standard position."
95,"CONCLUSION:
 1)  Small bowel obstruction at the area of ileal anastomosis, likely related
 to fecal obstruction and impaction.

 INDICATION:  80-year-old with trauma.

 No prior examinations.

 SUPINE PORTABLE TRAUMA RADIOGRAPHS INCLUDING THE CHEST AND PELVIS:  Underlying
 trauma board obscures full detail.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  A
 left posterior, likely 10th rib fracture, is seen with a mild step off.
 Increased interstitial markings throughout both lung fields without
 cephalization, Kerley B lines, or pleural effusion, is likely due to
 underlying fibrosis.  Bilateral apical capping is also likely due to scarring.
 The heart is mildly enlarged.  Apparent mediastinal widening is likely due to
 supine nature of the film.  The aortic contour is normal.  The ET tube is in
 standard position and NG tube descends below the diaphragm with tip off the
 field of view.

 Single pelvic radiograph demonstrates no fractures or dislocations. No

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: Status post MVA, car vs tree.

 No prior CT scans are available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were aquired
 helically from the lung apices through the pubic symphysis with 150 cc of
 Optiray conrast.  There were no adverse reactions to contrast administration.

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no evidence of traumatic aortic injury.
 The aorta is of normal caliber and demonstrates no surrounding hematoma or
 active extravasation.  The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.  No
 pleural or pericardial effusions are seen. Minimal dependent changes are seen
 within the lung bases.  No pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar or
 mediastinal nodes are seen.  No pneumothorax is present.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver enhances symmetrically without
 evidence of surrounding hematoma or laceration.  The spleen is normal.
 Pancreas and duodenum are unremarkable without evidence for traumatic injury.
 Both kidneys enhance symmetrically without perinephric fluid or laceration.
 The gallbladder, adrenal glands, and intraabdominal loops of small bowel are
 unremarkable.  No mesenteric fluid collection is seen.  The celiac, superior,
 and inferior mesenteric arteries are unremarkable.  The SMV, splenic and
 portal veins are all patent.  There is no ascites or free intraabdominal air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Distal ureters, bladder, and sigmoid colon are
 unremarkable.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.   Adjacent to the rectum
 is a dense oval calcific density which measures 13 mm in greatest dimension.
 This finding is of unknown etiology, but given the calcification, it is likely
 a chronic finding.  There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  Within the cecum is
 an area of increased attenuation which may simply represent inspissated stool,
 but which has the appearance of a pedunculated polyp. No pathologically
 enlarged inguinal or pelvic nodes are seen.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is a fracture of the right humeral head which is
 comminuted with impaction of the distal fracture fragment.  The fragmented
 humeral head is articulating within the glenoid fossa. A comminuted, but
 nondisplaced fracture of the right clavicle is also present.  There is
 widening of the right sternoclavicular joint. The underling subclavian vessels
 are patent, without evidence of surrounding hematoma.  No scapular fracture is
 seen. There are deformities of multiple ribs anteriorly, bilaterally,
 suggestive of traumatic injury. Degenerative changes are seen throughout the
 spine.  No pelvic fractures are seen. Visualized portions of the proximal
 femurs are normal."
107,"IMPRESSION:

 1.  Focal cecal wall thickening near the ileocecal valve, likely corresponding
 to primary lesion.  Local lymphadenopathy measures up to 10 x 7 mm.

 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis
 versus consolidation.

 3.  Multiple peripheral ground-glass nodules in the lungs may be of infectious
 origin although metastatic disease is not excluded.  Close interval followup
 is recommended.  Borderline mediastinal lymph nodes may also be re-evaluated
 at this time.

 4.  Thyroid nodule in the left lobe should be correlated with prior imaging or
 further evaluated with routine thyroid ultrasound.

 5.  8-mm focus of enhancement within segment 7 of the liver may represent an
 FNH or hemangioma.  Recommend continued attention on follow up."
108,"IMPRESSION:
 AP chest compared to [**5-22**] and 12:

 Large bilateral pleural effusions, improved on the left since [**5-23**],
 obscure much of both lungs.  I doubt that pulmonary edema is present.  Heart
 size is indeterminate.  Mediastinal vessels are not particularly dilated.  I
 doubt that the cause of the effusions is heart failure.  Hepatic, renal, and
 thyroid function should be assessed.

 Findings were discussed with the resident caring for this patient at the time
 of dictation."
109,"IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute intracranial process.
 2.  No evidence of stenosis, aneurysm, dissection or occlusion.
 3.  Mild atherosclerotic disease in the cavernous portion of the bilateral
 internal carotid arteries.
 4.  Tiny infundibulum at the origin of the left posterior communicating

111,"IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increase in inflammatory change within the left retroperitoneum and flank,
 with gas contrast density, and soft tissue density all filling this area.
 There is enlargement of the left psoas as well.  Findings are consistent with
 a combination of fistulous connection between bowel and necrotic mass,
 abscess, and surrounding inflammation.  While aspiration could be attempted if
 clinically indicated, no focal fluid collection appears easily amenable to
 this.

 2.  Bilateral hydronephrosis, unchanged.

 3.  Increase in size of segment V liver lesion now measuring 3.2 cm.

 4.  Bibasilar atelectasis of the lungs.

 These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 103564**] at the time of exam

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  Again seen are metallic sutures fixating multiple
 comminuted fractures of the frontal calvarium.  There is discontinuity of the
 bone, with no osseous fusion of these fractures.  The previously seen
 pneumocephalus has resolved.  Bilateral subdural fluid collections have
 decreased slightly in size measuring 5 mm in greatest diameter.  There is a
 small osseous fragment within the subdural space.  The frontal sinuses are
 distorted and there is soft tissue and fat within the left frontal sinus.  The
 right frontal sinus is moderately aerated.  There is persistent mucosal
 thickening in the ethmoid air cells and mild mucosal thickening in the
 visualized portion of the left maxillary sinus.  The visualized brain
 parenchyma is within normal limits, with no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, or
 infarction.  The ventricles are normal in size and configuration.

 Again seen is non-fusion of the anterior process of C1 as well as rotation of
 C1 about C2.  While this may be positional, this finding has persisted over
 multiple CTs and is concerning for rotary subluxation."
120,"IMPRESSION:
 1.  Severe aortic valvular calcifications, without significant calcifications
 of the ascending aorta.
 2.  Moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions, with associated basal
 atelectasis, more on the right.

 CHEST CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

 A subcentimeter nodule in the left thyroid gland is similar to prior (2:7).
 No supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy is
 identified.  A left precarinal lymph node has decreased in size now measuring
 5 mm as compared to 9 mm previously. Prior bulky axillary lymphadenopathy has
 resolved. The thoracic aorta is non aneurysmal throughout its course and
 grossly patent.  No central pulmonary embolism is identified on this venous
 phase study.  There are mild coronary atherosclerotic calcifications.  There
 is a trace pericardial effusion, unchanged from prior.

 The tracheobronchial tree is patent subsegmental levels without bronchial wall

 MRI OF THE CERVICAL SPINE:

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with Type II dens fracture on CT of the spine.
 For further evaluation.  The patient has right-sided weakness.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2, and STIR sagittal and gradient echo axial images of the
 cervical spine were acquired.  The axial images are limited due to motion.

 FINDINGS:  As suggested by history, there is a linear signal abnormality
 through the dens indicating fracture.  The fracture corresponds to a Type II
 fracture.  There is no malalignment seen at the fracture site.  The atlanto-
 odontoid distance is well maintained.  The spinal canal dimensions at C1 and
 C2 level are also maintained.

 Degenerative changes are seen at C3-4 and C4-5 levels.

 At C5-5 and C6-7 levels there is moderate spinal stenosis with mild extrinsic
 compression of the spinal cord.  The spinal stenosis is secondary to disc
 bulging and ligamentous thickening.

 At C7-T1 and inferiorly to T3-4 degenerative changes are identified without
 spinal stenosis.

 MR BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRAST, [**2121-7-11**]

 HISTORY:  Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma with confusion and change in

 Sagittal short TR, short TE spin echo imaging was performed through the brain.
 Axial imaging was performed with long TR, long TE fast spin echo, FLAIR,
 gradient echo, and diffusion technique.  No contrast was administered.  No
 prior brain imaging studies are available for comparison.

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of metastatic disease on this non-contrast
 examination.  Note, however, that contrast enhancement is by far the most
 sensitive measure of the likelihood of metastatic disease.  If there is a
 concern of potential brain metastasis, a repeat examination with contrast
 administration is recommended.  There is no evidence of masses or hemorrhage.
 There is extensive periventricular white matter hyperintensity on the FLAIR
 images suggesting chronic small vessel ischemia.  The ventricles and sulci are
 prominent, compatible with the patient's age."

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  46-year-old man with right femoral and right tibial plateau
 fractures status post ORIF, now with cellulitis of right shin and edema of
 thigh and tenderness.

 FINDINGS:  Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 654**] of the right common femoral,
 superficial femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.  Normal flow,
 augmentation, compressibility, and waveforms are demonstrated.  Intraluminal
 thrombus is not identified."
207,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  66-year-old female with newly diagnosed CLL, here to evaluate for
 cervical lymphadenopathy.

 COMPARISON:  CT torso without contrast performed the same day.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the neck without
 intravenous contrast.  Coronally and sagittally reformatted images were
 generated and reviewed.

 FINDINGS:  This study is limited by the absence of intravenous contrast.
 Allowing for this limitation, there are multiple prominent cervical lymph
 nodes at all levels and stations.  The majority of these lymph nodes measure
 up to 1 cm in short axis and meet CT size criteria for lymphadenopathy.  Even
 though a number of these lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged by CT
 size criteria, the multiplicity and wide extent make them compatible with
 lymphadenopathy.

 The visualized upper mediastinum demonstrates numerous, enlarged lymph node
 conglomerates in the bilateral axillary regions measuring up to 20 x 15 mm in
 the right axilla and 27 x 23 mm in the left axilla.  Multiple superior
 mediastinal lymph nodes appear prominent.  The visualized lung apices are
 clear.  The central tracheobronchial tree is patent.

 The visualized posterior fossa is unremarkable.  The visualized paranasal
 sinuses and bilateral mastoid air cells are well pneumatized.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is no acute cervical fracture or malalignment.  No
 suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified in the bone."
208,"PFI REPORT
 PFI:  Placement of temporary hemodialysis line catheter with VIP port via the
 left IJ access with the tip of the catheter in the right atrium and the
 catheter is ready to use."
209,"IMPRESSION:

 1. Loss of the aortic contours concerning for mediastinal hematoma.
 Consolidations are likely representing pulmonary contusion.
 2. No fracture seen within the visualized aspects of the pelvis."
210,IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions.
211,"WET READ: LLTc MON [**2156-3-15**] 11:56 PM
  Mild loss of the grey white differentiation may be related to technique, but
  given history, transient global hypoxia may be a cause. Correlate with
  neurological exam. No acute hemorrhage or fracture. Mild sinus disease.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post arrest.

 No comparison studies available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired 5-mm axial images of the head were obtained without
 the use of IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed at
 2-mm slice thickness.

 FINDINGS:  There is mild loss of the [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation
 globally, some of which can be attributed to technique.  The ventricles and
 sulci are normal in size and configuration.  There is no evidence of
 hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or large vascular territorial infarction.  The
 suprasellar and quadrigeminal cisterns are preserved.  There is no suspicious
 osseous lesion.  Mild mucosal thickening is seen within the ethmoid and
 maxillary sinuses.  The middle ear cavities and mastoid air cells are clear.
 Left ocular lens is not seen."
212,"IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**2154-3-15**]:48 p.m.:

 Tip of the endotracheal tube is at the level of the sternal notch, no less
 than 6 cm from the carina.  Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out
 of view.  Right internal jugular line ends in the upper right atrium and could
 be withdrawn 5 cm to place it in the mid or lower third of the SVC.

 Heart size is top normal.  Lung volumes are low.  Borderline interstitial
 edema has developed over the past three hours.  In the left apex, there is
 vascular engorgement and possible bronchiectasis.  The right apex is traversed
 by large ropey, linear opacities which appear to define cystic spaces.  This
 could be bronchiectasis alone or bronchiectasis and cavitation.  As such,
 active tuberculosis needs to be considered in this patient until excluded
 either by documentation of stable radiographic scarring or clinical means.

 Findings were discussed by telephone with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2936**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 367**] at the time of
 this dictation."
213,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male status post leg bypass, evaluate for pneumonia.

 COMMENTS:  A single AP view of the chest was reviewed and compared with PA and
 lateral chest radiographs from [**2123-8-9**].

 The tip of a right IJ catheter overlies the distal SVC.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  The aorta is calcified and tortuous but not dilated.
 No pneumothorax is identified.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.
 There has been no change in diffuse opacity within the right lobe which may
 reflect possible aspiration or asymmetric edema.  The left lung is relatively
 clear.  There is moderate right convex scoliosis."
214,"IMPRESSION:
 1.  The liver is echogenic, and heterogeneous, consistent with fatty
 infiltration, however, other forms of diffuse disease such as cirrhosis or
 fibrosis cannot be excluded with this examination.
 2.  Small complex cyst in the right lobe, followup recommended.
 3.  Gallbladder full of sludge, which also extends into the common duct, which
 is not dilated. No evidence of cholecystitis.
 4.  Normal portal venous architecture."
215,IMPRESSION:  Healing femoral and tibial plateau fractures.
216,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: History of multiple abdominal surgeries with nausea, vomiting, and
 symptoms of obstruction.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images are obtained from the lung bases to pubic
 symphysis after the administration of oral and IV contrast.  100 cc of Optiray
 nonionic contrast were administered without complications.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  Visualized
 portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable.  The patient is status
 post cholecystectomy. There are multiple surgical clips at the inferior margin
 of the liver.  There is a splenule.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, right kidney, and stomach are unremarkable.  The jejunum and ileum are
 mildly dilated, measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter.  At the ventral
 pelvic walll, there is herniation of the small bowel through the ventral wall
 without evidence of incarceration.  At the L4 level, there is a transition
 point between proximally dilated small bowel and distally decompressed bowel,
 separated by a hyperdense ring representing a surgical anastomosis.  This may
 represent an ileo-ileal anastomosis or an ileo-cecal anastomosis.  Just
 proximal to this anastomosis, the bowel is stool-filled, and the fecal
 material appears to cause an intraluminal obstruction within the bowel at the
 anastamosis.  There is a small amount of soft tissue stranding adjacent to
 this transition point. There is no abdominal lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  Again, some of the small bowel within the pelvis is
 dilated, with a decompressed colon.  The uterus is unremarkable.  The left
 ovary has a focal calcification, likely representing a small dermoid
 calcification.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

 Evaluation of the osseous structures demonstrates no suspicious osseous
 lesions.  There is degenerative change of the spine.  Also, note is made of
 surgical staples throughout the abdomen and pelvis related to her prior
 surgeries.

 Coronally reformatted images support these findings."

 CT TORSO, [**2116-3-19**]

 COMPARISON:  [**2111-1-5**].

 HISTORY:  82-year-old female with history of aneurysm and lobectomy and VP
 shunt with vomiting and altered mental status.

 FINDINGS:  Contiguous helical acquisition through the chest, abdomen and
 pelvis was performed with intravenous contrast.

 CT CHEST:  The heart is normal in size.  There is atherosclerotic disease of
 the coronary arteries and aorta.  The pulmonary artery and branch vessel
 opacifies normally with no evidence of intraluminal thrombus.  The aorta
 opacifies normally with no evidence of aortic dissection.  There is no
 mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy identified.  There is left basilar air
 space disease identified.  The right lung is clear.  A surgical clip is noted
 at the right lung base.  Post-surgical changes within the lungs are noted
 status post right upper lobectomy.  There are diffuse emphysematous changes
 identified.  There are old right-sided rib fractures noted.  The osseous
 structures are otherwise intact.  There are degenerative changes of the
 bilateral shoulders and spine.

 CT ABDOMEN:  There is mild-to-moderate intra- and extra-hepatic biliary
 dilatation which is new compared to the prior study dated [**2110**].  Also noted is
 a probable soft tissue-density filling defect within the mid/distal common
 bile duct. The common hepatic bile duct measures 17 mm in diameter.  The
 patient is status post cholecystectomy.  The pancreas is normal in appearance
 with no evidence of pancreatic ductal dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands,
 and bowel are normal in appearance.  There are multiple low-density lesions
 noted within the kidneys bilaterally which are too small to characterize but
 likely represent renal cysts.  There is no free air or free fluid identified.
 There is atherosclerotic disease of the descending aorta.  There is a
 ventriculostomy shunt catheter identified.

 CT PELVIS:  There is a left adnexal cyst which appears somewhat larger
 compared to the prior study and currently measures 2.8 cm.  There is
 diverticulosis of the sigmoid and descending colon without evidence of
 diverticulitis.  No pelvic masses or lymphadenopathy is identified.  The
 osseous structures are intact with degenerative changes noted within the
 lumbar spine."
218,"FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, [**9-29**]

 HISTORY:  Evaluate pleural effusions and possible volume overload."
219,"IMPRESSION:
 1.  Air distention of the cecum with adjacent fat stranding and fluid.
 Dilated small bowel without a discrete transition.  Given the history, this
 finding may represent a cecal volvulus that has spontaneously reduced.  It
 remains at risk for re-volvulus.  Observation with low tolerance to re-image
 should symptoms recur should be maintained.
 2.  Severe right hip osteoarthritis.

 Discussed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3381**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3382**] at 11:00 p.m. on [**2102-11-3**]."
220,"IMPRESSION:
 1.  Postoperative changes from prior craniotomies and correction of frontal
 bone fracture.
 2.  Persistent pneumocephalus in the anterior frontal convexities bilaterally.
 The persistence of this finding suggests a communication between the
 intracranial structures and perhaps the sinuses.  There is a discontinuity of
 the inner wall of the left frontal sinus, which could perhaps be the site of
 connection.  However, better evaluation of this could be performed with a
 facial CT scan.
 3.  No new intracranial hemorrhage is identified.  No CT evidence of an acute
 territorial infarct.
 4.  No hydrocephalus."
221,"IMPRESSION: Interval placement of left sided subclavian line with its distal
 tip within the upper SVC. The distal tip of the subclavian line is directed
 laterally. There is no evidence of pneumothorax."
222,"IMPRESSION:
 1.  Liver laceration, involving segments V, VI and VIII, and extending from
 the medial to lateral margins of the right hepatic lobe.  There is a tiny
 amount of perihepatic fluid, consistent with hemorrhage.
 2.  Nondisplaced transverse sternal fracture."

 flows freely back into the gastric fundus. There is no spillage of contrast
 into the peritoneal cavity. Incidental note is made of contrast in the
 transverse colon."
224,"FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-3**], the monitoring and support
 devices remain in satisfactory position.  The areas of increased opacification
 at the bases have substantially decreased.  On the left, this could well
 reflect expectoration of a mucus plug with only mild residual atelectasis."
225,"INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male with abdominal pain, elevated LFTs, sepsis.

 COMPARISON:  [**2121-10-23**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were obtained
 following administration of intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformatted images were obtained.

 CT CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Multiple prominent mediastinal lymph
 nodes are noted, mostly not meeting CT criteria for pathological enlargement,
 largest in the subcarinal station measuring 15 mm in the short axis diameter.
 No pathologic axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The airways are patent to
 the subsegmental levels bilaterally. There are bilateral patchy ground-glass
 opacities in the lower lobes, as well as diffuse tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 2085**] nodules,
 including lingula, both lower lobes.  Mild bronchiectasis is noted in the
 lower lobes bilaterally.

 There are trace bilateral pleural effusions.  Dense calcifications of the
 coronary arteries are noted.

 Again noted multiple hypoattenuating foci in the parenchyma, overall size and
 distribution are unchanged from the prior study.  Cholelithiasis, without
 evidence of acute cholecystitis.  Small amount of abdominal ascites, mostly
 perihepatic, as well as tracking along the right paracolic gutter.  There is
 increased mesenteric stranding, which is felt to be related to fluid third
 spacing.  The kidneys enhance equally and excrete contrast normally.  The
 spleen, splenule, adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The pancreas is atrophic.
 Abdominal loops of large and small bowel are unremarkable.  There are multiple
 shotty retroperitoneal lymph nodes, more prominent, than on the prior study
 measures 8 mm in the short axis diameter in the retrocrural station, 9 mm in
 short axis diameter in aortocaval station.  There is no free air in the
 abdomen.

 CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The prostate is enlarged, measuring 5.5
 cm.  The rectum, sigmoid colon are unremarkable.  The urinary bladder is
 partially collapsed and contains a Foley catheter, the wall appears thickened.
 There is no free pelvic fluid.  Multiple small pelvic lymph nodes are noted,
 largest measuring 10 mm in short axis diameter along the right common iliac
 vessels.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are compression fractures of L1, T12 and T10 vertebral
 bodies.  There is loss of near 75% of L1 vertebral body height, approximately
 25% superior endplate depression of T12 vertebral body and stable
 approximately 50% vertebral body height loss of T10 vertebral body.  There is
 generalized mineralization of the osseous structures.

 There are diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications of the abdominal aorta,
 without evidence of aneurysmal dilatation."

 INDICATION:  S/P MVA.  Evaluate for pneumopericardium or mediastinal hematoma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contrast enhanced cT imaging of the chest with 150 cc Optiray.
 Non-ionic contrast was used due to patient allergy.

 COMPARISON:  [**2106-9-12**].

 CT CHEST W/CONTRAST:  There is no evidence of pneumopericardium.  Previously
 noted soft tissue density in the mediastinum, suggestive of hematoma is
 unchanged in comparison to prior exam.  The mediastinal size and configuration
 is unchanged compared to prior exam.  The great vessels appear intact.  There
 is no mediatinal, hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy.  There are no pleural
 effusions noted.  There are bilateral chest tubes.  The previously noted left-
 sided pneumothorax has decreased significantly in size in comparison with
 prior exam.  There are bilateral air-space consolidations present at the
 bases.  These air-space consolidations are mildly increased in comparison with
 prior exam.  There is subcutaneous air noted in the soft tissues of the left
 thorax associated with chest tube insertion.  An NG tube is in place within
 the body of the stomach.  SG catheter is in place.  An ET tube is in position
 just above the carina."

 surgical clips in the paravertebral right midline, and midline vertical staple
 line.  First, water soluble contrast, then thin barium were administered to
 the patient, and fluoroscopic images obtained.  These show opacification of
 the stomach, however, despite approximately 15 minutes of imaging, contrast
 did not pass beyond the pylorus into the duodenum."
229,"IMPRESSION:
 Right upper lobe atelectasis."
230,"FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right hip fracture.

 Fluoroscopic assistance provided to the surgeon in the OR without the

 intramedullary rod and interlocking screws traversing a mid shaft femoral
 fracture."
231,"FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
 INDICATION: Status post fall down stairs, trauma.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired noncontrast axial images are obtained through
 the sinuses and skull base.  CT coronal reconstructions are obtained.

 CT SINUS/MAXILLOFACIAL: There is a left occipiital fracture which extends down
 to the foramen magmnum. There are likely bilateral fractures near the [**Last Name (un) 7008**]-
 occipital fissures that approxiamte the carotid canals. There is a fracture
 through the [**Last Name (un) 7008**]-mastoid portion of the left temporal bone.  There is fluid
 (?blood) within the left external auditory canal. There is also a fracture of
 the lamina paprycea on the right. There is intraorbital emphysema as well as a
 small hemoatoma along the medial wall of the right orbit.  There is
 pneumocephalus behind the right side of the frontal bone as well as the right
 middle cranial fossa which is increased when compared to the previous study.

240,"FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:
 History of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient had a previous angiogram on
 the previous day. The patient was moving and it was difficult to catheterize
 the right internal and right vertebral arteries at the time. Hence the patient
 was brought back and the present angiogram was performed under general
 anesthesia.

 TECHNIQUE:
 Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after
 explaining the risks, indications and alternative management. Risks explained
 included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with
 possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.

 The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and
 placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
 draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
 was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
 Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
 out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
 saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
 continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
 and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of
 heparin in 1000 cc of saline).

 The following blood vessels were selectively catherized, and arteriograms were
 performed from these locations: right common carotid artery, right internal
 carotid artery, right vertebral artery.

 Please note that the previous dicatation has been lost in the process of
 transcription. This is a redictation.

 RIGHT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:
 No significant atherosclerotic disease noted.

 RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:
 There is good opacification of the proximal and distal right internal carotid
 artery, anterior and middle cerebral artery branches. There is an irregular
 aneurysm noted arising from the posterior communicating artery and measures
 approximately 10 x 6 x 4 mm in size. This appears to be the source of the
 hemorrhage.

 RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY:
 There is good opacification of the proximal and distal right vertebral artery,
 basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery on both sides. No definite
 aneurysm noted."

 FINDINGS:

 LUNG BASES:  The lung bases are clear, the heart is normal in size.

 ABDOMEN:  A hypodensity is again seen within segment V of the liver, increased
 in size compared with prior, now measuring 3.2 cm in its longest axis.  There
 is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  The gallbladder demonstrates
 dense layering material consistent with sludge.  The spleen appears normal.
 The pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The distal esophagus,

    30.8 mCi Tc-99m Sestamibi Stress ([**2189-8-26**]);
 HISTORY:
 67 yo woman with a history of CAD with prior NSTEMI referred for evaluation.

 SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:

 For pharmacologic coronary vasodilatation 0.4 mg of regadenoson (0.08 mg/ml) was
 infused intravenously over 20 seconds followed by a saline flush. She had no
 anginal symptoms or ischemic ECG changes.

 IMAGING METHOD:

 Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi. Tracer was
 injected approximately 45 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 Following resting images and following intravenous infusion,  approximately
 three times the resting dose of Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m sestamibi was administered intravenously.
 Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes following tracer
 injection.

 Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.

 This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.

 INTERPRETATION:

 The image quality is adequate but limited due to soft tissue and breast
 attenuation.  There is activity adjacent to the heart in the rest images.

 Left ventricular cavity size is normal.

 Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, mild reduction in photon
 counts involving the basal inferior wall.  The defect improves with attenuation
 correction.  The reversibility appears artifactual due to adjacent activity.

 Gated images reveal normal wall motion.

 The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 74% with an EDV of 74%"

 PROCEDURE:
 1.  Initial spot fluoroscopic image.
 2.  Removal of existing malpositioned nasogastric tube.
 3.  Placement of a 5 French catheter into the stomach.
 4.  Placement of a 12 French percutaneous Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 7943**] gastrostomy tube and 3
 T-tacks.
 5.  Post-tube placement spot fluoroscopic imaging with contrast injection.

 MEDICATIONS: Moderate sedation was provided with divided doses of 0.5 mg IV
 Versed and 25 mcg IV fentanyl throughout the intraprocedure time, during which
 continuous hemodynamic monitoring was performed.  Additionally, the patient
 received 1 g IV Kefzol prior to the procedure.

 PROCEDURE:  Prior to initiation of the procedure, written informed consent was
 obtained and a preprocedure timeout was performed.  Upon initiation of
 procedure, the patient had excessive coughing and bloody sputum.  Initial
 fluoroscopic spot image was performed demonstrating the nasogastric tube
 malpositioned within the retropharynx.  The nasogastric tube was removed and
 under fluoroscopic guidance, a 5 French glide catheter and guidewire were used
 to position the catheter within the stomach.  This was secured to the nose.
 Next, the abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile manner.  The stomach was
 insufflated with air.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, after local lidocaine
 administration, a needle was advanced into the stomach, and a T-Tack was
 deployed.  Location was confirmed with contrast injection.  Sequentially, two
 additional T-tacks were deployed.  Following this, an 18-gauge needle was used
 to access the stomach, for which an 0.035 J-wire was advanced.  Sequential
 fascial dilatation was performed followed by placement of a 12-French
 Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 7943**] tube.  The pigtail was formed within the stomach.  Contrast

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with intracranial hemorrhage after fall and
 supratherapeutic INR, for further evaluation.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial, and FLAIR, T2 and susceptibility, as well
 as diffusion axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.  T1
 axial and coronal images of the brain were obtained following gadolinium.
 Correlation was made with the head CT exams of [**2191-8-5**] and [**2191-8-4**].

 FINDINGS:  Brain MRI:

 Again, bilateral subdural collections are identified, which are T1 isointense
 to the brain and hyperintense to the brain on T2W images with fluid-fluid
 levels.  The findings indicate subacute/chronic subdural hematomas.  Mild
 indentation on the adjacent brain is seen in both frontal and parietal regions
 without midline shift.  No evidence of hydrocephalus or midline shift is
 noted.  Following gadolinium administrtion, diffuse miningeal enhancement is
 identified along the subdural hematomas, as well as along the tentorium and
 base of the skull.  No abnormal parenchymal enhancement is identified.  Subtle
 enhancement adjacent to the left anterior clinoid is again noted, which was
 better visualized on the head CT, indicating a small meningioma.

 Tiny area of susceptibility related low signal within the left subcortical
 frontal [**Doctor Last Name 181**]- white junction could be due to trauma and small area of blood
 products.

 PROCEDURE:  Successful conversion of prior temporary dialysis line to left-
 sided 15.5 French 23 cm cuff-to-tip dual-lumen dialysis catheter.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Informed consent was obtained from the patient and
 the [**Hospital 353**] healthcare proxy via telephone.  A preprocedure timeout was
 performed documenting the nature of procedure and the patient identity.  The
 patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the indwelling left
 neck/left dialysis catheter was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.
 Initial scout radiograph demonstrated appropriate positioning of the line.
 First, attention was made towards creation of a tract.  Appropriate
 measurements were made and the subcutaneous tissues were anesthetized with
 epinephrine buffered lidocaine.  A small incision was made and the dialysis
 catheter was tunneled through the left chest wall subcutaneous tissue. The
 indwelling catheter was then aspirated removing all heparin and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 66**] wire
 was advanced through the indwelling lumen into the IVC.  The previously placed
 line was then removed over a wire and a 16 French sheath/dilator device was
 advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC.  The indwelling [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire
 and dilator device were then removed and the dual-lumen dialysis catheter was
 advanced through the peel-away sheath.  Post-procedural radiograph
 demonstrated appropriate positioning of the dialysis catheter with the tip in
 the right atrium.  The skin [**Doctor Last Name 695**] near the jugular access entry point was
 closed with 2-0 Vicryl and the catheter was secured with 0 silk. Sterile
 dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well with no
 immediate post-procedure complications.

353,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute MI, hypotension and continued hematocrit drop, evaluate for
 retroperitoneal bleed.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast images were performed from the lung bases to the
 pubic symphysis.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST:  Bilateral small pleural effusions are
 present with associated dependent atelectasis.  There is engorgement of the
 vascularity within the bases and thickened interstitial lines consistent with
 mild pulmonary edema.  The base of the heart is unremarkable.  Non-contrast
 images of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas and adrenals are within
 normal limits.  There are subtle areas of high attenuation within the renal
 collecting system, presumably contrast from the recent cardiac
 catheterization.  There is no intraabdominal free fluid or free air.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is no pelvic free fluid.  The
 unopacified bowel loops are within normal limits.  Contrast is seen within the
 urinary bladder and it appears within normal limits.  The prostate and seminal
 vesicles are unremarkable.  There is no retroperitoneal hematoma.  There is no
 groin hematoma.  A central venous line is seen entering from the right groin.

 pneumothorax.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 removal of the right chest tube.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  Otherwise,
 little change."
357,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post MVA with CT showing mediastinal hematoma.  Aortogram
 was requested by Trauma Service.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits were explained to the
 patient's family and consent was obtained.

 The attending Radiologist, Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 134**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 135**], was present during the entire
 procedure.

 The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the right groin
 was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Under 1% Lidocaine local
 anesthesia, the right common femoral artery was accessed with a 19-gauge
 needle and a .035 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire was advanced into the abdominal aorta through
 the needle.  The needle was exchanged for a 7 French [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 4740**] catheter,
 which was advanced over the wire into the ascending aorta with the tip just
 above the aortic valve.  An aortogram was performed in RPO and LPO projections
 respectively with injection of nonionic contrast.  The aortogram demonstrated
 a normal appearing ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending aorta, all
 major branches from the arch, as well as bilateral internal mammary arteries.
 The left common carotid artery has a common origin with brachiocephalic
 artery. There is no evidence of contrast extravasation, irregularity or
 aneurysm. The tip of the left chest tube is abutting the aortic arch. This
 finding was relayed to the ICU resident.  At the end of the procedure, the
 catheter was removed over the wire and hemostasis was achieved with manual
 compression.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications."
358,"IMPRESSION:

 PORTABLE CHEST, [**2177-10-13**].

 INDICATION:  Fever and mental status changes.

 No prior radiographs for comparison.

 Heart is upper limits of normal in size.  Aorta is slightly tortuous.  Within
 the right infrahilar region, there is an area of increased opacity adjacent to
 a slightly elevated hemidiaphragm.  This is most likely due to crowding of
 vessels related to atelectasis, but an area of early pneumonia or aspiration
 cannot be excluded, and dedicated PA and lateral chest radiographs may be
 helpful for more complete assessment of this finding."
361,"FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Aplastic anemia and back pain.

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR images, axial T1-
 weighted images and post-contrast sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:

 The vertebral bodies are well maintained and normally aligned.  There is more
 fatty replacement of the marrow than typical, probably related to the
 patient's aplastic anemia.  There is a small central disc herniation at T5/6
 which indents the spinal cord minimally.  At that level, the subarachnoid
 space is widely patent dorsally.  There is also minimal posterior protrusion
 of disc material at T6/7, T8/9 and T9/10.  The subarachnoid space and the
 neural foramina are well maintained.  Note is made of mild cervical
 spondylosis.

 MRI OF THE THORACIC SPINE WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Aplastic anemia.

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted and STIR images, axial T2-
 weighted images and post-contrast sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:

 There is fatty replacement of much of the visualized marrow.

 At L1/2, there is a small central and left-sided disc herniation which indents
 the thecal sac minimally.  There is a mild disc bulge at L2/3.  The L3/4 disc
 is unremarkable.  There is a small central disc herniation with an annular
 tear at L4/5 which indents the thecal sac minimally.  There is minimal
 spondylolisthesis.  There is some facet hypertrophy but no significant canal
 stenosis.

 The L5/S1 disc is narrowed.  There are disc space osteophytes, particularly in
 the right foramen without compression of the exiting L5 nerve root.  No
 abnormal enhancement of the cauda equina is seen.  The conus medullaris
 endometrial stripe at the L2 level."
362,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever and tachypnea.

 COMPARISON PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST:  Compared to two days prior, moderate-to-
 severe pulmonary edema has improved, including improvement in interstitial
 edema and vascular congestion.  While aeration of the right lower lung has
 improved, a focal consolidation here and in the left upper lung are more
 conspicuous. The PIC catheter has been advanced, now terminating in the lower
 SVC. A dual- lumen hemodialysis catheter again ends in the lower superior vena
 cava. Small bilateral pleural effusions likely persist.  There is no
 pneumothorax."

 HISTORY:  Right tibial plateau fracture.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the right knee were obtained without
 contrast.  Reconstructed images in the coronal and sagittal planes were
 obtained.

 CT RIGHT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is a comminuted lateral tibial plateau
 fracture with impaction.  The maximal inferior displacement of the impacted
 fragments measures 11 mm.  Cortical disruption extends caudally
 anterolaterally, as well as caudally posterolaterally without displacement.

 The medial tibial plateau is unremarkable.  The articular portion of the
 distal femur appears to be intact.  In the distal femoral diaphysis, there is
 a partially visualized intramedullary rod with two interlocking screws seen.

 Soft tissue windows demonstrate a joint effusion, as well as soft tissue
 swelling about the knee joint.  There are foci of gas seen in the adjacent
 soft tissues adjacent to the distal femur likely related to the patient's
 recent surgery."

 Please note that this is a redictation. The previous dictation has been lost
 during the process of transcription.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:
 86-year-old male with a subarachnoid hemorrhage along the Sylvian fissures
 bilaterally and small intraventricular hemorrhage in the occipital horns
 bilaterally.

 TECHNIQUE:
 Informed consent was obtained from the patient and the patient's family after
 explaining the risks, indications and alternative management. Risks explained
 included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent, with
 possible treatment with stent and coils if needed.

 The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and
 placed on the biplane table in supine position. Both groins were prepped and
 draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access to the right common femoral artery
 was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall needle, under local anesthesia using
 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic precautions.
 Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was introduced and the needle taken
 out. Over the wire, a 5 Fr vascular sheath was placed and connected to a
 saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of saline) with a
 continuous drip. Through the sheath, a 4 Fr Berenstein catheter was introduced
 and connected to continuous saline infusion (with mixture of 1000 units of
 heparin in 1000 cc of saline).

 The following blood vessels were selectively catherized, and arteriograms were
 performed from these locations: left common carotid artery, left internal
 carotid artery, left subclavian artery, left vertebral artery.

 LEFT COMMON CAROTID ARTERY:
 No significant atherosclerotic disease noted.

 LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:
 There is good opacification of the left proximal and distal left internal
 carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral artery branches. There is a small
 aneurysm measuring approximately 2.5 mm in diameter with a wide neck and
 appears to arise at the origin of the posterior communicating artery.

 LEFT VERTBRAL ARTERY:
 There is minimal narrowing noted at the origin of the left vertebral artery.
 There is good opacification of the proximal and distal left vertebral artery,
 basilar artery and posterior cerebral arteries on both sides.

 The right internal carotid artery and the right vertebral artery could not be
 catheterized secondary to severe tortuosity of the vessels and the patient's
 breathing. The patient will be brought back for re-angiogram of these vessels
 under general anesthesia."
384,"IMPRESSION:

 Interval postoperative changes.  Hazy central and upper lobe opacities
 suggesting failure."
385,"IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval severely worsening and spread of subcutaneous air along the left
 posterolateral pelvic wall, compatible with aggressive tissue necrosis.
 2.  Hyperdense material is seen within the necrotic tissue, compatible with
 extraluminal oral contrast from enterocolonic fistulization to the necrotic
 tissues.  Small amount of free air is noted along the left lateral pelvic
 cavity.  Recommend consideration for surgical consult for extensive surgical
 debridement.
 3.  Grossly unchanged large amorphous mid pelvis mass with fluid.  No
 percutaneously drainable fluid collection.
 4.  Unchanged bilateral hydronephrosis and hydroureter.

401,"IMPRESSION:  Slightly abnormal loop of ileum in the mid-abdomen at the site of
 prior anastomosis with findings that are overall most suggestive of
 postsurgical change, and unlikely to represent focal Crohn's disease. However,
 given distortion of the adjacent mesentery, an uncomplicated internal hernia
 cannot be entirely excluded.  Additionally, equivocal wall thickening and
 hyperenhancement could reflect inflammation, including possible ulceration, at
 the anastamotic site."
402,"FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is an 83-year-old man who was in robust health until
 several months prior.  He began a progressive, devastating, debiliting
 decline. Now, he suffers from multiple medical problems and pontine
 infarctions which have essentially left him near ""locked-in"".  On
 [**1-6**], the patient underwent MRA which suggested long segmental areas of
 narrowing in the basilar.  The patient has not tolerated long-term
 conservative therapy and angioplasty/stenting is considered. The patient and
 his family participated in a family meeting when all options were discussed
 extensively with the patient and family on Friday of last week and the
 treatment is now attempted this Monday ([**2109-2-11**]).

 PROCEDURE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives to the procedure are
 explained to the patient and his children.  They understand and sign the
 consent form.

 The patient is brought to the neurointerventional suite and placed under
 general anesthesia.  A Swan-Ganz catheter is placed via left subclavian
 approach, radial A line is present.

 The groin is prepped  and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Using standard
 Seldinger technique a 6 French Arrow sheath was placed in the groin.
 Arteriogram was performed through the dilator and demonstrates an extremely
 tortuous iliac and femoral system.  Ultimately, a sheath exchange is performed
 over an exchange length 038 microwire for a 25 cm 6 French bright tip sheath.
 Utilizing a combination of 5 French Berenstein, 5 French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 2, 5 French
 [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] 3 in conjunction with long tapered Terumo glidewire and standard
 Terumo glidewire the following vessels are selected:

 The 5 French Berenstein catheter is used to select the right common carotid
 artery.  The carotid bifurcation is studied in AP and lateral projections
 utilizing road map technique.  There is no significant stenosis.  The catheter
 is placed in the internal carotid artery and the camera centered over the
 head.  Arteriographic assessment in the AP and lateral planes demonstrates
 filling of the posterior cerebral territory, predominantly via leptomeningeal
 collaterals to the posterior cerebral.  There is extensive intracranial
 atherosclerotic disease. Venous drainage is predominantly to the right side.

 Next, [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1408**] 3 catheter is used to select the left common carotid artery.
 Examination is performed over the head via hand injection utilizing AP and
 lateral films.  Again, seen are areas of atherosclerotic narrowing.  There is
 a large posterior communicator with direct supply to the posterior cerebral on
 this left side.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein catheter is put into the base of the left
 vertebral artery.  This is studied in the neck in AP and lateral positions.
 Then, the camera was centered in the brain and studied in AP and lateral
 positions.  The left vertebral is an extremely tortuous vessel with a complete
 360 degree turn in its base.  The anterior spinal access is a large access
 arising from this artery with prominent spinal drainage seen on this
 examination.  There is no filling of the basilar on this injection.  The
 distal vertebral flows into the posterior inferior cerebellar. The posterior
 inferior cerebellar supplies anastomosis to the superior cerebellar artery.

 Next, the 5 French Berenstein was placed into the right subclavian.  Injection
 and examination of the right subclavian was done with the blood pressure cuff
 placed on the right arm. The right vertebral is a small vessel that appears to
 terminate in a small PICA.  The basilar was not filled.  As the caliber of the
 vertebral was smaller than the catheter being utilized, it was decided to not
 enter the vertebral.

 The examination is discussed extensively with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 37273**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 15994**] of
 Stroke Neurology.  After extensive discussion, the decision is made to stop at
 this point.

 FINDINGS:  Corresponding to the CT findings, there is an extensive mass with
 multiple lobulations of the right side of the neck consistent with either
 direct growth of tumor or regional metastatic lymphadenopathy.  The extent of
 the masses, taking the conglomerate together, measures 5.5 x 2.2 x 3.2 cm.
 The right internal jugular vein is widely patent above the level of the mass,

 INDICATION:  Subcutaneous crepitus after G-tube placement.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the
 hip joints without IV contrast.

 CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Subcutaneous gas tracks along the lateral and
 anterior soft tissues.  No pneumothoraces are identified. There are small
 bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent passive atelectasis.  Two punctate
 high attenuation areas in the left lower lobe are likely granulomata.  No
 other opacities are seen within the lungs.  There is an NG tube extending
 through the esophagus.  A small hiatal hernia is poresent.  The heart and
 great vessels are grossly normal.

 CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is subcutaneous gas throughout the
 abdomen.  Gas is seen within the peritoneum.  There is a G-tube in place,
 without evidence of gas attenuation surrounding the subcutaneous portion.  A
 few small foci of gas attenuation are seen within the left and right upper
 peritoneal cavity.  A small collection of gas is seen under the left lobe of
 the liver.  High attenuation with the gallbladder likely represents vicarious
 excretion of previously administered IV contrast.  The liver, pancreas,
 spleen, and adrenal glands are normal in appearance.  Several round low
 attenuation structures within the kidneys are likely simple cysts.

 CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Subcutaneous gas tracks along the anterior
 lower abdominal wall into the inguinal canals and scrotum.  There is also
 subcutaneous gas attenuation within the tissues of the left thigh extensor and
 adductor compartments.  Multiple diverticula are seen throughout the sigmoid
 colon.  The prostate is enlarged.  There is retained barium within the rectum.

 FINDINGS:  Large right and small-to-moderate left pleural effusions are
 present.  The right effusion is similar to prior study, but left effusion has
 increased in size.  Adjacent opacities in the right mid and both lower lungs
 are probably due to atelectasis.  Questionable rounded opacity at level of
 first right costochondral junction is likely due to asymmetrical degenerative
 changes at the right costochondral junction, but repeat non-rotated chest

 Per trauma team, patient is neurologically intact.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was performed through the cervical spine
 without administration of IV contrast, and multiplanar reformatted images were
 then obtained.

 CT C-SPINE WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Straightening of the cervical spine is likely
 due to imaging in a cervical collar.  Otherwise, there is no evidence of acute
 fracture or malalignment seen within the visualized skull base through T2.
 Degenerative changes are most notable at the C4-5 level where there are both
 posterior and anterior osteophyte formation as well as narrowing of the
 intervertebral disc space.  CT does not delineate the intrathecal detail as
 does MR; however, no abnormality is noted within the spinal canal except for
 mild narrowing of the canal at the C3-4 and C4-5 levels due to osteophyte
 formation.  No paraspinal hematoma is noted.

 RADIOLOGIST: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 596**] performed the procedure. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 192**], the
 Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right baslic vein
 was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set. Hard
 copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a  PICC line measuring 41 cm in length was then placed through
 the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic
 guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film
 of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The catheter was secured
 to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.

 COMPARISON: Outside CT abdomen dated [**2195-7-15**].

 TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images were obtained throughout the lumbar spine after
 intrathecal injection of contrast from a myelogram. Sagittal and coronal
 reconstructions were provided. The images were reviewed using soft tissue and
 bone window algorithms.

 FINDINGS:

 The normal lordotic curvature of the lumbar spine is maintained. There is
 minimal dextroscoliosis of the lumbar spine. There is grade I retrolisthesis
 of L3 over L4 and of L5 over S1 vertebra. There is grade I anterolisthesis of
 L4 over L5 vertebra.

 The vertebral bodies are normal in height. Schmorl's nodes are noted along the
 inferior endplates of L1 and L4 vertebral bodies.

 There is decreased L3-L4 to L5-S1 intervertebral discs height.

 The distribution of the contrast surrounding the conus medullaris appears
 normal and the conus terminates at the level of L1-L2 level.

 At T11-T12, there is posterior disc bulge indenting the ventral thecal sac.

 At T12-L1, there is no neural foraminal or spinal canal stenosis.

 At L1-L2 and L2-L3, there is no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal
 stenosis.

 At L3-L4, there is posterior disc bulge with superimposed central protrusion
 which along with posterior endplate osteophytes and facet arthropathy causes
 moderate spinal canal stenosis and crowding of nerve roots of cauda equina.
 The disc with end plate and facet osteophytes causes moderate bilateral neural
 foraminal stenosis.

 At L4-L5, there is posterior disc bulge which along with ligamentum flavum
 thickening and facet arthropathy causes moderate spinal canal stenosis. The
 disc with end plate and facet osteophytes causes severe right and moderate
 left neural foraminal stenosis.

 At L5-S1, there is disc bulge asymmetric to the left indenting ventral thecal
 sac and possibly indenting the traversing right S1 nerve root. The disc with
 end plate and facet osteophytes causes mild right and severe left neural
 foraminal stenosis.

 Mural calcification is noted in visualized abdominal aorta. Visualized

 There is interval removal of the endotracheal tube.  The tip of intra-aortic
 balloon pump is now seen at 2.6 cm below the top of the aortic arch.  The tip
 of Swan-Ganz catheter with femoral approach is in the left pulmonary artery,
 unchanged.  The dual-chamber pacemaker is seen on the right upper chest with
 leads in the expected location of the right ventricle and right atrium.

 The remaining chest radiograph is unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged, with persistent obliteration in the left cardiac border by the
 underlying pleural effusion.  The perihilar haziness has slightly decreased,
 demonstraing a decrease of the underlying pulmonary edema. There is no
 pneumothorax.  Opacification of the left base persists, consistent with a
 combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Slight interval improvement
 of aeration of right base is noted, with residual atelectasis and small
 pleural effusion.  Moderate- to-severe degenerative disease in the underlying
 spine is unchanged."
462,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATIONS:  79-year-old male with carotid artery stenosis, status post right
 ICA stent.

 FINDINGS:

 RIGHT:  B-mode images of the right carotid bifurcation show typical stent
 architecture.  The right common carotid artery waveforms are within normal
 limits and have a velocity of 45 cm/sec.  The right internal carotid artery
 waveform is normal in morphology with velocities of 104/46.  The ICA/CCA ratio
 is 2.3.  By velocity criteria, this would correlate with a 1-39% stenosis,
 unchanged from previous.

 LEFT:  B-mode images of the left carotid bifurcation show an echolucent,
 heterogeneous plaque at the origin of the internal carotid artery.  The common
 carotid artery waveforms are within normal limits and have velocities of 58
 cm/sec.  The internal carotid artery waveform has spectral broadening and
 velocities of 307/134 cm/sec.  The ICA/CCA ratio is 5.2.  By velocity
 criteria, this would correlate with an 80-99% stenosis.  There has been
 progression from the previous exam of [**2128-11-23**].

 Both vertebral arteries have antegrade flow."

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN WITH MR VENOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Markedly increased headache and sleepiness.  Assess for new dural
 sinus or venous occlusion.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging was obtained.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  MRI scan of the brain dated [**2115-1-17**] and reported
 by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 2009**] as revealing ""new occlusion of the right posterior
 cerebral artery at its P2 segment.  Stable partial thromboses of the left
 transverse and sigmoid sinuses as well as left internal jugular vein. Near-
 complete thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus.  Partial thrombosis of the
 right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**] while their
 counterparts on the left are probably patent.""

 FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior study of [**2115-1-17**] shows a very
 similar pattern of abnormal FLAIR signal within the white matter of both
 cerebral hemispheres.  Some of these areas continue to have hemosiderin
 residua and have been considered the remnant of prior venous infarcts.  There
 are no areas of abnormal signal on the diffusion-weighted scans to raise the
 question of an evolving arterial infarct.  It should be mentioned that this
 study does not include MR angiography and thus the present status of the P2
 segment of the right posterior cerebral artery, felt to be occluded on the
 prior study, cannot be re-assessed.  The principal arterial vascular flow
 patterns are identified.  There has been no overt change in ventricular size
 or configuration, either.

 TECHNIQUE:  Two-dimensional time-of-flight imaging with multiplanar
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  There appears to be negligible change in the extent of the
 extensive thrombosis of multiple major venous sinuses, described in detail in
 the prior report.  Thus, I do not believe there has been  perceptible
 recanalization. The presence of occlusion of the right basal vein of
 [**Doctor Last Name 4323**], and likely the ipsilateral internal cerebral vein, is again
 redemonstrated."

 HISTORY:  Alcoholic with hematocrit of 15 and fluid noted on fast exam.
 Evaluate for intraperitoneal hemorrhage versus ascites.

 No priors are available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen and
 pelvis without intravenous or oral contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformations were evaluated.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  Limited evaluation of
 lung bases displays mild atelectasis within the lingula, but is otherwise
 clear.  There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Marked prominence of the
 interventricular septum is consistent with the patient's known underlying
 anemia.  Of note, the Hounsfield attenuation of the blood within the
 descending aorta is approximately 20.

 The liver is enlarged with nodular contour consistent with underlying
 cirrhosis with no focal hepatic lesions noted on this non-contrast
 examination.  The gallbladder is non distended and displays mild wall edema
 likely related to third spacing.  The spleen is enlarged measuring
 approximately 15 cm in the coronal orientation.  The pancreas, adrenal glands,
 and left kidney are normal.  A small simple right renal cyst is noted.  No
 pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified with scattered mesenteric
 and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, which are likely reactive.  Mild induration
 of the mesentery is noted. There is no free air within the abdominal cavity. A
 small fat-containing umbilical hernia is present.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS OR ORAL CONTRAST:  There is a mild
 colonic diverticulosis with no evidence of acute diverticulitis.  Mild wall
 thickening involving the transverse and ascending colon is present.

 A mild-to-moderate amount of free fluid noted within the abdomen and pelvis is
 in characteristic distribution for ascites.  The fluid measures predominantly
 simple and less than the Hounsfield unit measurement of blood within the
 aorta.  Prostate is unremarkable.  No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are
 present within the pelvis.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No malignant-appearing osseous lesions are present.  There is
 multilevel degenerative changes noted within the lumbar spine with mild grade

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY

 HISTORY:  Status post fall, on Coumadin, with facial injuries including
 fracture into the carotid canal.  Evaluate the carotid arteries.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast imaging of the head.

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior head CT scan of [**4-24**], a new right posterior
 parietal/occipital acute subdural hemorrhage has developed, measuring
 approximately 6 mm in maximal width and approximately 33 mm in length.  The
 hemorrhage causes effacement of the adjacent sulci.  As was mentioned in the
 facial bones CT report, more generalized chronic subdural hygromas appear to
 have mildly evolved since the prior study.  These, as well cause mild cerebral
 sulcal effacement, but there is no shift of normally midline structures or
 overt change in ventricular size appreciated.  At this time, there is also
 subarachnoid hemorrhage subjacent to the right frontal skull fracture as well
 as within the posterior aspect of both sylvian fissures.  A tiny amount of
 possible pneumocephalus is seen in relationship to the falx cerebri.  This
 finding was not seen on the prior study.

 CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE UPPER NECK AND HEAD, EXTENDING FROM THE LEVEL OF THE
 HYOID BONE AS FAR CEPHALAD AS THE VERTEX OF THE SKULL:  Multiplanar
 reconstructions as well as volumetric offline processed images were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is no definite sign of compromise of the lumen of the
 internal carotid artery through either carotid canal.  The more distal
 internal carotid arteries are patent.  There are moderate left and milder
 right atherosclerotic calcifications involving the supraclinoid portions of
 the internal carotid arteries.  The vertebrobasilar arterial system appears
 patent.  Using the vascular lumen as an index, no definite signs of a
 dissection are noted, although in this regard, fat saturated MR imaging is
 more sensitive in detecting an intramural hematoma.  No other definite
 additional areas of hemodynamically significant stenosis or aneurysm formation
 are present at this time."

 MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN

 HISTORY:  Hypercoagulable state with history of venous sinus thrombosis and
 associated venous infarcts.  Here with Wernicke's aphasia, new left-sided
 infarcts with questionable hemorrhage in that locale.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted brain imaging.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2114-5-18**] MR scan of the brain reported by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4114**]
 as showing ""diminished visualization of the left transverse sinus which is a
 new finding since [**2107-11-12**].  However, a thin rim of flow signal is
 identified within this region indicating recanalization from a chronic
 thrombosis.  Although signal changes indicate this to be a chronic finding,
 clinical correlation is recommended.""

 Diffusion-weighted images are normal.  The present 3T study shows somewhat
 greater visibility of the susceptibility regions, likely representing prior
 hemorrhages, compared to the prior study which was performed [**Company 57802**]. This
 difference in visibility likely is related to the higher field strength of the
 present examination technique, rather than new hemorrhages.

 However, there is definitely more white matter FLAIR hyperintensity seen both
 within the anterior and posterior aspects of the left temporal lobe.  This
 change raises the concern for progression of venous infarction since the prior
 MR study, as opposed to a superimposed inflammatory process.  There is stable,
 minimal right sided bowing of the septum pellucidum, suggesting that these

 board artifact.  Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably
 accounted for by these technical factors.  There is a rounded density along
 the right heart border - this likely represents vascular structures, but
 attention to this area on followup films is requested.  No gross CHF, focal
 contusion, effusion, or pneumothorax is detected.  Some opacity overlies the
 lower trachea, but is of uncertain significance on this view.  The remainder
 of the trachea is within normal limits.

 HISTORY:  44-year-old male status post short-segment ileal resection following
 blunt abdominal trauma, now with diarrhea and GI bleeding.  CT scan suggested
 focal Crohn's disease at the anastomotic site.  Evaluate for extent of small
 bowel inflammation or other pathology.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis dated [**2155-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet, including dynamic 3D imaging performed prior to, during, and
 following the uneventful intravenous administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 ml) of
 Magnevist intravenous contrast. VoLumen  oral contrast and 1 mg of
 intramuscular glucagon was also administered.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated and
 evaluated on the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Anteriorly in the mid-abdomen, at site of prior ileal resection and
 end- to- end anastomosis, there is a short-segment of slightly abnormal small
 bowel. This demonstrates transient saccular dilitation just upstream of the
 anastomotic site, but normal peristalsis on functional imaging.  There is
 equivocal wall thickening and a small focus of equivocal hyperenhancement
 (200:68).  However, there is no significant adjacent mesenteric inflammation
 or edema.

 Of note, the mesentery adjacent to this site does appear somewhat distorted,
 with overall deviation to the right abdomen. Given the mesenteric distortion,
 the possibility of an internal hernia cannot be entirely excluded.

 The remainder of the small bowel is unremarkable.  The large bowel is normal
 in appearance without wall thickening or distention.  There is no fluid
 collection to suggest abscess formation.  Small scattered mesenteric nodes are
 not pathologically enlarged.

 The visualized liver is normal in appearance.  There is no biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, and pancreas are normal. The
 major mesenteric vessels are widely patent.  The bladder is normal in
 appearance. The visualized marrow signal is normal.

 Multiplanar reformations provided multiple imaging perspectives for the

 CT SCAN OF THE FACIAL BONES

 HISTORY:  Status post fall.  On Coumadin.  Evaluate for fracture or
 retrobulbar hematoma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast imaging of the facial bones with sagittal and
 coronal reconstructions.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  CT scan of the head, dated [**2197-4-24**] reported by Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 1009**] as revealing numerous facial and skull fractures- see his extensive
 report for complete description of the findings.

 FINDINGS:

 The massively comminuted skull fracture is not completely depicted on this
 study as a number of its components lie at the vertex of the calvarium.  The
 principal right frontal fracture appears unchanged in its configuration as
 does the extensively comminuted nasal bone fractures.  There is an extensive
 fracture involving the sphenoid sinus septum, with rotation of the fracture
 fragment present.  There is a probable additional fracture involving the
 basisphenoid, principally to the right of midline.  The right orbital roof
 fracture is well depicted on the coronal images as a ""blowout"" type.  At this
 time, there is no definite sign of either right orbital emphysema or
 pneumocephalus, aside from a tiny focus of gas near the superior portion of
 the falx cerebri. Nevertheless, the fact that these more extensive gas
 collections seen on the previous scan does raise the concern for communication
 between the orbit and sinuses with the intracranial region. There is a
 crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right
 orbital roof, consistent with an orbital hematocyst. The maximum thickness of
 this abnormality is 6 mm. Transversely, it extends from approximately the
 level of the superior oblique muscle to the area of the lacrimal gland.  There
 is no proptosis. There is a mild degree of right and more moderate left-sided
 periorbital soft tissue swelling noted, particularly on the medial side
 adjoining the nose.  There is partial imaging of the petrous temporal bones,
 and confirmation of the suspected complex fracture of this bone on the left
 side, including the ossicular dislocation involving the incus. There is
 bilateral presumed hemotympanum and considerable opacification of the mastoid
 sinuses, along with marked degrees of opacification of both maxillary sinuses,
 likely with hemorrhagic contents.  The sphenoid sinus is essentially totally
 opacified and there are bilateral air-fluid levels and substantial
 opacification of both ethmoid sinuses.  Moderate mucosal thickening and a
 probable air-fluid level is noted within the frontal sinus.  While the present
 study is not optimized for brain tissue detail, there is probably evidence for
 right frontal subarachnoid blood, but no epidural hematoma.  Over the 24 hours
 between scans, there is development of what appear to be bilateral subdural
 hygromas, somewhat more prominent on the patient's left side."

 [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 325**] and [**Doctor Last Name 27**] were present throughout procedure.

 CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:
 20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%. 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 1 mg Versed were given
 intravenously in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring for
 conscious sedation.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:
 The procedure was described and informed consent obtained. The stomach was
 insufflated with air, and point of entry into the body of stomach was marked.
 Following local anesthetic infiltration, a 19 gauge spinal needle was inserted
 under fluoroscopic guidance until tenting of the stomach wall was noticed. The
 lumen of the stomach was then entered, and a flush of air was noted through
 the spinal needle. At this time, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through
 the needle into the lumen of the stomach, and the needle was removed. The
 tract was then dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 French dilators under
 fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount of contrast material was injected during
 the course of dilatation which again demonstrated gastric location. The tract
 was continually dilated up to 18 French, and a 16 French MIC gastrostomy tube
 was advanced over a stiff guidewire. At this time, contrast was injected
 through the tube and demonstrated its tip to be still in the stomach. A
 significant amount of previously injected contrast material was noted in a
 large hiatal hernia projecting above the left hemidiaphragm. With the
 guidewire projecting over the body and fundus of the stomach, the securing
 balloon of the MIC gastrostomy tube was inflated with contrast material and
 normal saline, and was noticed to project outside the body of the stomach. The
 tube was deflated, the wire removed, and contrast material was then injected
 directly through the gastrostomy tube, which demonstrated a peritoneal
 location.

 The stomach was reinsufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were placed
 through the wall of the stomach and secured to the anterior abdominal wall. A
 19 gauge needle was then used to access the stomach in an adjacent separate
 puncture site over the anterior abdominal wall. An 0.035 wire was placed
 through the needle, the needle removed, the tract dilated to 7 French. A 7
 French sheath was then placed over the needle, and access into the gastric
 antrum was obtained. A 5 French multipurpose catheter was advanced over the
 guidewire, and the guidewire was exchanged for an angled glidewire. Following
 several technical manipulations, the guidewire was passed through the first
 portion of the duodenum and eventually beyond the ligament of Treitz. The
 multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the glidewire was
 exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff guidewire. The multipurpose catheter and
 7-French sheath were removed, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was then
 advanced over the Superstiff guidewire into the duodenum. The inner dilator
 was removed, and a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunstomy catheter was placed
 through the peelaway sheath. With continued advancement of the catheter
 through the proximal duodenum, the guidewire in the ligament of Treitz
 retracted. This in part was due to the lack of flexibility in the
 gastroduodenal region, secondary to the presence of a large hiatal hernia. At
 this time, a T-fastener placed previously was noted to have dislodged during
 advancement of the catheter and peelaway sheath. At this time, four new T-
 fasteners were placed under fluoroscopic guidance under continued gas
 insufflation via the NG tube. Access was again gained to the body of the
 stomach, and a 14 French pigtail catheter was placed fluoroscopic guidance,
 such that the pigtail formed in the antrum of the stomach. The catheter was
 secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrak
 dressing.

596,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  83 year-old male with recent diagnosis of breast cancer,
 congestive cardiac failure and possible pneumonia.  Also had recent right
 heart catheterization.  Request to evaluate pleural effusions and to rule out
 retroperitoneal bleed following cardiac catheter study.

 COMPARISON:  Reference is made to a previous renal ultrasound of [**9-4**] and abdominal ultrasound of [**5-12**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT-acquired axial images were obtained from the lung
 apices to the level of the lesser trochanters.  No intravenous contrast was
 administered due to the patient's impaired renal function.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformats were evaluated.

 CT OF THORAX:
 Prior median sternotomy noted.
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the right side.
 There is associated collapse with volume loss involving the posterior basal
 segments of both the right and left lower lobes.  More confluent airspace
 opacity is seen radiating from the hila to involve the posterior and apical
 segments of the right upper lobe.  The right middle lobe remains well aerated.
 Findings are most in keeping with pulmonary edema. Ground-glass change is also
 seen involving the left upper lobe again in keeping with less severe pulmonary
 edema.  Satisfactory position of the right-sided PICC line with the tip
 terminating in the lower SVC.  Dense calcification of the left coronary artery
 are seen.  There are multiple nonenlarged mediastinal and axillary lymph
 nodes.
 There is a 17 x 15 mm thickening in the left subareolar region likely
 representing the primary tumor.

 CT OF ABDOMEN:
 Note is made of a fundal gastric diverticulum (2:50).
 The liver is of diffuse increased attenuation with an average Hounsfield value
 of 100.  Causes of this appearance include hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis,
 Wilson's disease and, most likely in this patients case, amiodarone drug
 therapy.
 No focal liver lesions are identified.  The gallbladder outlines normally. The
 spleen is enlarged measuring 15 cm in long axis. Note is made of a 17-mm low-
 attenuation focus in the lower pole of spleen, which is incompletely
 characterized, but most likely represents a hemangioma.
 Both kidneys demonstrate cortical thinning; however, no focal lesions are
 identified.  Both adrenal glands are normal in size and appearance.  There are
 no pathologically enlarged upper abdominal.
 Abdominal aorta demonstrates sparse pleural calcifications, but is otherwise
 normal in characters and caliber
 CT OF PELVIS:
 The balloon of the Foley catheter lies within the prostatic portion of the
 urethra and should be repostioned. The prostate is normal in size and
 demonstrates coarse calcifications.

 Normal appearance of the common femoral artery and vein with no significant
 perivenous hematoma following right heart catheterization.  There were no
 enlarged inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymph nodes.

 Note is made of a 21 x 18 mm low-attenuation cystic structure arising from the
 anterior aspect of the pancreatic body. A larger 2.8 x 3.5 cm cystic mass is
 seen in the pancreatic tail at the splenic hilum ( 2:56). Several other sub
 centimeter low attenuation foci are seen adjacent to the pancreas ( 2:56,57).
 Findings are in keeping with multiple  pancreatic cysts or cystic neoplasms
 and could be further evaluated with MRCP.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  Mild degenerative changes are seen involving the
 thoracolumbar spine.  A 3-mm sclerotic focus in the right ilium has the
 appearance of a benign bone island."
597,"FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION: 75 year old male with intracranial hemorrhage after a
 fall and findings on a prior noncontrast CT scan concerning for an aneurysm or
 mass.

 TECHNIQUE: Axial imaging of the brain without IV contrast enhancement,
 followed by helical CT imaging of the major intracranial arteries during rapid
 infusion of 100 cc of Optiray.  Subsequent delayed contrast enhanced images of
 the brain were obtained.

 CT BRAIN W/O IV CONTRAST:  The patient's known bilateral mixed density
 subdural collections are again noted.  These appear unchanged in size and
 extent in the interval.  There is persistent flattening of the adjacent
 cerebral gyri as well as narrowing of the lateral ventricles.  The basal
 cisterns are not effaced.  The [**Doctor Last Name 181**]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
 The previously described 15 x 8 mm hyperdense focus along the left anterior
 clinoid and the suprasellar space appears unchannged.  There are probable
 punctate calcifications within it.  Differential considerations include
 aneurysm or dense mass.

 CTA OF INTRACRANIAL CIRCULATION: The above described hyperdense focus adjacent
 to the left anterior clinoid and suprasellar space does not demonstrate any
 evidence of enhancement during the arterial bolus.  Additionally, there is
 rightward displacement of the supraclinoid portion of the left internal
 carotid artery as well as posterior displacement of the M1 segment of the left
 MCA, indicating an element of mass effect.  However, both of these vessels
 appear to be intact.   There is no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation.  The
 visualized intracranial arterial circulation is otherwise normal.

 DELAYED CONTRAST ENHANCED CT IMAGES OF THE BRAIN: The previously described
 hyperdensity corresponds to a lobular mass abutting the left anterior clinoid
 and adjacent suprasellar space.  This lesion demonstrates modest contrast
 enhancement and contains punctate calcifications within it.  The most likely
 differential consideration in this location given these characteristics is a
 meningioma."

 INDICATION: Patient is status post trauma with tachycardia and question aortic
 injury.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 150 cc of
 Optiray contrast per fast bolus protocol. Thin section and multiplanar
 reformations were obtained through the chest.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: The heart, pericardium, and great vessels are
 unremarkable. Specifically, the thoracic aorta is well opacified and upon
 review of axial and multiplanar reformation images there is no evidence of
 aortic tear, dissection, or transection. There is however a moderate hematoma
 adjacent to the aorta.  There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary
 lymphadenopathy. There are no pleural effusions. Bilateral chest tubes are
 noted, the right extending toward the posterior diaphragm and the left
 extending superiorly to the apex before descending along the mediastinum to
 the approximate level of the aortic arch. A moderate pneumothorax is noted
 inferiorly on the left. In addition, a small amount of air is tracking along
 the peripheral portion of the left chest tube. There is also subcutaneous air
 tracking along the thoracic cage on the left.

 Dense opacification of the lungs is noted inferiorly bilaterally which is
 consistent with aspiration (particularly given history of difficult intubation
 with vomiting). In addition, there are scattered focal opacifications
 throughout both lungs. Of note, a focal area of opacification in the left
 upper lobe contains several small air filled spaces peripherally in the lung
 which may represent post traumatic pneumatoceles. Scout film demonstrates a
 Swan-Ganz catheter is well positioned with the tip in the main pulmonary
 trunk. An endotracheal tube is well positioned approximately 2.5 cm above the
 carina. A nasogastric tube is also noted and well positioned.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, kidneys and small bowel loops are unremarkable. There is no
 lymphadenopathy. A small amount of free fluid is noted throughout the abdomen
 which is consistent with history of peritoneal lavage. There is no free air.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: A Foley catheter is located within a somewhat
 distended bladder. Air within the bladder likely secondary to Foley placement.

 small amount of hypodensity adjacent to the shunt catheter which may represent
 adjacent edema, which is unchanged from the prior study.  There is a stable
 appearing region of hypoattenuation within the right frontal periventricular
 white matter which may represent the sequelae of microvascular angiopathy.
 Also noted is a stable appearing hypodensity within the right internal
 capsule, which is likely attributed to chronic ischemic changes.  Aneurysm
 clips are noted at the skull base.  Evaluation of the skull base is limited
 secondary to streak artifact from the clips.  The calvarium is stable in

 TECHNIQUE:  Multi detector CT acquired axial images were 1st obtained through
 the abdomen without contrast.  Next, after administration of 130 cc Omnipaque
 intravenous contrast, axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
 through the pubic symphysis.  3 minute delay images of the abdomen were
 obtained also.  Enteric contrast was given.  Coronal sagittal reformats were
 reviewed.

 FINDINGS:

 CHEST:

 There is a 11 x 6 millimeter hypoattenuating left thyroid nodule (3:4).  There
 are borderline prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, none of which meet CT size
 criteria for pathologic enlargement.  For example, one in the AP window
 measures 6 millimeters (3:23).  A precarinal lymph node measures 8 mm (3:24).
 A subcarinal lymph node measures 14-mm.  There is no supraclavicular or
 axillary lymphadenopathy.  There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the
 coronary vessels.  The heart size is normal and a small amount of pericardial
 fluid is present.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions. They are non
 loculated and nonhemorrhagic.  On background emphysema, there are several
 ground-glass nodules, with a peripheral distribution, most concentrated in the
 right middle lobe.  The largest measures 10 x 5 millimeters in the right
 middle lobe (3:  34).  Another indistinct cluster can be seen also in the
 peripheral right middle lobe, measuring 12 x 11 millimeters (3: 39).  There
 are several in the lingula and left lower lobe as well.  Airspace
 consolidation with air bronchograms are present in the basilar aspect of the
 bilateral lower lobes (3:  46, 49).

 There is an 8-mm focus of enhancement within segment 7 of the liver.  The
 gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, and spleen appear normal.  There may be
 a tiny gallstone.  There are two subcentimeter right renal hypodensities, 1 in
 the upper pole and 1 in the lower pole, both of which are too small to
 characterize.  The there are no stones or hydronephrosis and the kidneys
 enhance normally otherwise.  The portal, splenic, and mesenteric veins are
 patent.  The abdominal aorta is heavily calcified but is of normal caliber,
 with patent main branches.  The small bowel appears normal.

 There is focal wall thickening of the cecum, at the ileocecal valve (601 b:
 21).  There are small surrounding lymph nodes, the largest measuring 10 x 7
 millimeters (3: 84).  No other intra-abdominal masses seen.  There is no free

640,"FINAL REPORT
 MEDICAL HISTORY:  73-year-old man with anaplastic thyroid cancer, requiring a
 new right-sided PICC line and removal of an existing left-sided PICC line.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2522**] performed the procedure with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 7210**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 557**], the
 attending radiologist, present throughout the procedure.

 ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia was administered with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The right upper arm was prepped
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure huddle and timeout
 were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial vein was
 punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.  Hard
 copies of ultrasound images obtained before and immediately after establishing
 intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over the guide wire.
 There was difficulty in advancing the micropuncture wire through the right
 subclavian vein.  A venogram was performed using 20 cc of Optiray 60%.  The
 venogram demonstrates marked narrowing of the right subclavian vein with
 extensive venous collateralization.  Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 0.018
 guide wire was used to traverse the narrowed right subclavian vein.  A 4
 French PICC line measuring 40 cm was successfully positioned in the distal
 SVC.  The position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film
 of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guide wire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.  The patient
 tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate complications.

 Under sterile technique, the existing, non-functioning left-sided PICC line
 was removed.  A sterile dressing was again applied."

650,"IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to [**5-22**]:

 Heart shadow is little bit larger and upper lobe vessels are little [**Hospital1 45541**]
 than on [**5-22**], but there is no pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.  No free
 subdiaphragmatic gas."
651,"FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pulmonary nodules and
 known history of CLL.

 COMPARISON:  [**2170-8-20**], [**2170-7-17**] and multiple prior studies dating
 back to [**2170-5-17**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the chest was obtained from thoracic inlet to upper
 abdomen without administration of IV contrast.  Axial images were reviewed in
 conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.

 FINDINGS:

 There are no pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymph
 nodes.  Aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in diameter.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion.  Small amount of pericardial effusion
 is demonstrated, grossly stable since the prior study.  The imaged portion of
 the upper abdomen demonstrates right lobe of the liver hypodensity, more
 conspicuous on the current study than on the prior examination but overall
 unchanged in size within the limitation of this comparison.  This lesion is
 not seen on the prior CT torso from [**2170-6-28**] contrast-enhanced study, but
 can be seen on [**2170-7-17**] examination, thus potentially reflecting
 hemangioma, opacified after injection of contrast, correlation with ultrasound
 of the liver as a first step might be considered.

 Axillary lymph nodes appear to be substantially decreased in size as compared
 to [**2170-5-17**] and [**2170-6-28**], but overall unchanged since the most
 recent prior study from [**2170-8-20**].  Splenomegaly and calcification of the
 spleen are persistent.

 There are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.  Endplate
 changes in the thoracic and lumbar spine are stable.

 Airways are patent to the subsegmental levels bilaterally.  The vast majority
 of previously demonstrated pulmonary nodules with surrounding ground glass
 opacities have resolved or decreased in size.  On the other hand, multiple new
 but similar in appearance pulmonary nodules with center of solid density and
 surrounding ground glass halo have appeared:  4:36, 94, 109, 126, 143, 152,
 157, 165, and the largest one in the left lower lobe, 178, 7.7 mm in diameter.
 Some of the nodules have a discrete ground glass halo, some of them are solid,
 with slightly irregular contours.

 Previously demonstrated stable pulmonary nodules are unchanged."

 CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2197-4-24**].

 HISTORY:  80-year-old man status post fall, taking Coumadin; evaluate for
 fracture.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helical 2.5 mm DCT axial sections were obtained from the skull
 base through the upper T3 level, sagittal and coronal reformations were
 prepared, and all images are viewed in bone, soft tissue and lung window on
 the workstation.

 FINDINGS:  There are no comparisons on record.  For detailed description of
 the extensive facial, sinus and temporal bone fractures, please see separate
 report of concurrent head CT.  There are ET and NG tubes in situ ""tamponading""
 the prevertebral soft tissues, and limiting their evaluation.  However, no
 gross prevertebral soft tissue hematoma is identified.  The cervical alignment
 is, overall, intact and the normal lordosis is maintained, with only minimal
 retrolisthesis of C4 on C5 and C5 on C6, likely related to disc and facet
 joint degenerative disease.  The atlantoaxial and atlanto-occipital alignment
 is maintained and no skull fracture is demonstrated to involve the skull base,
 itself.  No acute cervical spine fracture is identified.  There are multilevel
 degenerative changes, most prominent at the anterior atlantoaxial
 articulation, as well as the C5-6 and C6-7 levels, where there are relatively
 [**Name2 (NI) 2336**] disc-spondylotic ridges, which do not significantly narrow the ventral
 spinal canal.  There is moderate right neuroforaminal narrowing at C5-6 and
 more mild right neuroforaminal narrowing at the C6-7 levels, but no other
 significant neuroforaminal narrowing is seen.

 There is no abnormal air within the cervical soft tissues, and the cervical
 airway appears grossly intact with ET tube in place.  Noted are relatively
 symmetric dependent opacities at both lung apices, representing either
 atelectasis or contusion; these are better characterized on the concurrent CT

 INDICATION:  43 year-old female patient post TAH/BSO and oomentectomy in [**2189**]
 for stage 3 ovarian adenocarcinoma, now post colectomy/colostomy on [**2192-7-6**]
 with recurrence and small bowel invasion for further evaluation.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams including CT torso performed [**2192-12-4**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained on a 1.5
 Tesla magnet including dynamic 3D imaging obtained prior to, during and after
 the uneventful administration of 0.1 mmol/kg (17 mL) of gadolinium-DTPA.  900
 mL of VoLumen was also administered orally.

 Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformats and subtraction images provided multiple
 perspectives for the dynamic series.

 INDICATION:  A large pelvic mass (10:45)measuring 8.4 (AP) x 9.8 (CC) x 7.6
 (ML) cm from 8.1 (AP) x 5 (ML) x 7.1 (CC) cm [**2192-12-4**] becomes confluent with
 and causes near circumferential encasement involving a 15 cm segment of distal
 ileum causing an irregular lumen consistent with bowel wall invasion.  This
 lesion abuts and also likely involves the rectal wall (201:73).  There is near
 obliteration of the lumen due to mass effect but only minimal obstructive
 dilation of small bowel loops proximally.  The mass causes abrupt narrowing of
 the distal left ureter, moderate left hydronephrosis and mild left kidney
 atrophy which are similar to [**2192-12-4**].

 There are several stable enlarged paraaortic and nodes which measure just
 under 1 cm (13:128) and several high perirectal nodes measuring just over 1 cm
 (14:120-145).

 Layering sludge is noted in the gallbladder.  The pancreas, spleen, adrenals
 and right kidney are unremarkable. Hartmann's pouch and lower quadrant
 colostomy are stable.

 2D reformatted and 3D volume rendered images reviewed at interpretation
 support these findings."

 INDICATION:  History of Guillain-[**Location (un) **] syndrome with shortness of breath,
 desaturation, and tachycardia.  Evaluate for PE.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images were acquired through the chest without
 administration of intravenous contrast.  Subsequently, axial images were
 acquired through the chest during administration of 100 mL of intravenous
 Optiray.  Multiplanar reformations were performed.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism to the subsegmental
 levels bilaterally.  There is extensive atelectasis involving the right middle
 lobe and bilateral lower lobes, right greater than left, with near complete
 collapse of the right lower lobe.  Given the presence of anterior bulging
 along the medial aspect of the major fissure (4:41) and an area of adjacent
 hypoenhancing material in the right infrahilar region, the presence of right
 lower lobe pneumonia cannot be excluded.  There are no pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.

 There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, hila, or
 axillae.  The heart and imaged portions of the great vessels are unremarkable.
 The ET tube ends at the level of the carina.  The NG tube passes below the
 level of the diaphragm and out of the imaged area inferiorly.

 HISTORY:  59-year-old man with aortic stenosis.  Pre-op for AVR.  Surgery
 scheduled on [**2143-3-15**].

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  SINGLE FRONTAL UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac
 silhouette is mild-to-moderately enlarged.  The prominent ascending aorta is
 compatible with history of aortic stenosis.  Cephalization of prominent
 pulmonary vasculature and increased interstitial markings with Kerley B lines
 in the right lateral lung are compatible with mild baseline fluid overload.
 Mild bibasilar atelectasis is noted, but without focal airspace consolidation
 to suggest acute pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Mild multilevel degenerative changes are noted in the osseous structures."
697,"IMPRESSION:

 Given the presence of Kerley B lines and small effusions, the increased
 interstitial markings could represent asymmetric pattern of interstitial
 edema.  However, differential diagnosis includes other causes, such as
 infectious and neoplastic etiologies.  ?nodular opacities, left
 suprahilar region.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation."
698,"IMPRESSION:

 1.  Bilateral small pleural effusions with patchy atelectasis."
699,IMPRESSION:  Normal abdomen.
700,IMPRESSION: Increasing right pleural effusion.
701,"IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**12-26**].

 The heterogeneous and asymmetric pulmonary opacification, which has been a
 recurrent feature of the severely emphysematous lungs is probably pulmonary
 edema, since moderate bilateral pleural effusions persist.  As a result of
 this appearance; however, early pneumonia is likely to be missed.  Heart size
 is normal.  Pulmonary arteries are large, as before, suggesting pulmonary
 arterial hypertension and the transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
 pacer leads are unchanged in their positions.  The ventricular lead loops in
 the region of the tricuspid valve and does not extend the usual distance into
 the cavity of the right ventricle.  A right jugular line ends in the upper
 SVC.  Marked right apical pleural thickening can be attributed to prior
 tuberculosis, but remote chest radiographs need to be obtained to document
 stability in order to exclude a superior sulcus malignancy."

711,"FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  66-year-old woman with new diagnosis of CLL.  Evaluate for
 lymphadenopathy.

 COMPARISON:  No relevant comparisons available.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the thoracic outlet to the pubic
 symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast.  No IV
 contrast was administered per request of the clinical team as patient was
 going to receive nephrotoxic chemotherapy medications.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformats were obtained for evaluation.

 CT CHEST: No nodules are seen in the unenhanced thyroid gland.  The thoracic
 aorta and pulmonary artery is of normal caliber.  Numerous axillary lymph
 nodes are identified, ranging up to 1.5 x 2.0 cm in the right axilla (2:18)
 and 2.7 x 2.3 cm in the left axilla (2:12). Other larger axillary lymph nodes
 have a normal fatty hilum, e.g. a 1.6 x 6.0cm node in the right axilla
 (300b:35).  Multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes are not enlarged by size
 criteria.  Evaluation for hilar lymphadenopathy is limited without IV
 contrast, but there is no gross contour abnormality to suggest enlarged lymph
 nodes.  The heart, pericardium and great vessels are within normal limits
 aside from mild atherosclerotic calcifications in the LAD.  A trace
 pericardial effusion is within physiological range.  There is no pleural
 effusion.

 Lung window images demonstrate no worrisome nodule, mass, or consolidation.
 There is mild dependent bibasilar atelectasis.  Airways are patent to the
 subsegmental levels bilaterally.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs and for lymphadenopathy
 is limited without intravenous contrast.  A 1.3-cm hypodensity at the hepatic
 dome (2:43) is too small to characterize. The remainder of the unenhanced
 liver is unremarkable. The gallbladder is normal.  The spleen is enlarged,
 measuring 26.1 cm craniocaudally.  Small calcifications within the spleen
 suggest prior exposure to granulomatous disease.  A 1.5cm splenic hyperdensity
 (2:74) is nonspecific and may represent a small hemangioma.  The pancreas and
 bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is no hydronephrosis, renal stone
 or contour-altering renal mass.

 The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber without
 obstruction.  The appendix is visualized and is normal (2:89).  There is no
 free fluid and no free air.  The aorta is of normal caliber throughout with
 mild atherosclerotic calcifications.

 There is bulky retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. For example, a right caval
 node measures 2.0 x 4.9 cm (2:81). A left paraaortic node measures 3.0 x 2.6cm
 (2:79). There is a region of mesenteric stranding surrounding numerous small
 lymph nodes measuring up to 1.0cm (2:79, 87), which may be due to obstruction
 of lymphatic channels. A subcutaneous nodule in the left flank measures 1.0 x
 1.0 cm (2:64).

 CT PELVIS:  The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and uterus are normal.  Clips
 are seen in the sigmoid.  There is no free fluid.  Enlarged pelvic lymph nodes
 measure up to 2.9 x 1.6 cm on the right (2:113) and 1.8 x 4.3 cm at the left
 pelvic sidewall (2:108).  There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Visualized lung bases are clear.
 There is no pleural effusion.  The visualized heart and pericardium are
 unremarkable, without pericardial effusion.

 The liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Layering
 hyperdensity within the gallbladder likely reflects sludge.  There is a mild
 fullness of the right collecting system, without overt hydronephrosis.
 Moderately severe hydronephrosis of the left kidney and hydroureter, with
 associated atrophy of the left kidney, are stable in appearance.

 There is no free air or free fluid.  Mildly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes
 (2:45) measure 13 mm in short axis, and are similar to prior study.  A lymph
 node along the right iliac chain (2:62) measures 11 mm in short axis

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  A pelvic mass is slightly larger in

 CMR Technical Information:
 1) Structure: Axial dual-inversion T1-weighted images of the myocardium were
 obtained without spectral fat saturation pre-pulses.
 2) Function: Breath-hold cine Steady-state free precession (SSFP) images were
 acquired in the left ventricular 2-chamber, 4-chamber, horizontal long axis,
 contiguous short axis orientations, sagittal and coronal orientations of the
 left ventricular outflow tract, and aortic valve short axis orientations.
 3) Flow: Phase-contrast cine images were obtained transverse to the aorta
 (axial plane) and main pulmonary artery (oblique plane).
 4) Perfusion/Viability: Delayed enhancement (DE) images were obtained using a
 segmented inversion-recovery TFE acquisition, short-axis, four chamber and
 two-chamber long-axis images were obtained 15 minutes after injection of a
 total of 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine (29 Magnevist  solution).


 Findings:
 The images were acquired while the patient was in sinus rhythm.

 Structure and Function
 There was normal epicardial fat distribution without evidence of myocardial
 fatty infiltration. The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal
 intensity.  The pericardium appeared normal in thickness.  There was a small
 (< 1.0 cm), circumferential pericardial effusion. There were bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The origins of the left main and right coronary arteries were
 identified in their customary positions.  The diameters of the ascending
 aorta, descending aorta, and main pulmonary artery were normal.  The left
 atrial AP dimension was mildly increased.  The left atrial dimensions in the
 4-chamber view was mildly increased.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was mildly enlarged.  The left
 ventricular end-diastolic volume index was moderately elevated.  The
 calculated left ventricular ejection fraction was severely depressed at 29%,
 with severe regional and global systolic function.  There was severe global
 hypokinesis/akinesis with relative sparing of the basal and mid portions of
 the inferior and inferolateral walls.  The left ventricular mass was normal.
 The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index was normal.  The calculated
 right ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 51%, with normal regional
 and global systolic function.
 The aortic valve was trileaflet with normal valve area.

 Quantitative Flow
 There was no significant intra-cardiac shunt.  Aortic flow demonstrated no
 significant aortic regurgitation.  There was no significant mitral
 regurgitation.  The right ventricular stroke volume and pulmonic flow
 demonstrated mild pulmonic and tricuspid regurgitation.

 Viability
 There was hyperenhancement of the basal anterior septum, the mid and distal
 portions of the inferoseptal, anteroseptal, anterior, and anterolateral
 segments, and the apex.   The hyperenhancement was transmural, consistent with
 poor (<20%) likelihood of functional recovery after segment revascularization.
  The infarct/LV mass ratio was 0.33."
739,"IMPRESSION:
 1) Interval increase in size of bilateral pleural effusions with associated
 compression atelectasis.
 2) No evidence of pancreatitis or retroperitoneal hemorrhage."

 FNA OF THE CERVICAL LYMPH NODES

 INDICATION:  73-year-old man with right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy
 concerning for malignancy.

 After risk, benefits, alternatives and procedure were explained to the
 patient, written informed consent was obtained.  A preprocedure timeout was
 performed using three patient identifiers.

 Initial ultrasound imaging showed three lymph nodes in the right side of neck,
 measuring up to 1.8 x 2 cm.  The middle of these was chosen for FNA due to
 size and relative distance from adjacent jugular and carotid vessels.

 The site in the right neck was marked, then prepped with alcohol.

 25-gauge needle was used to perform two passes of the FNA through the lymph
 nodes under direct ultrasound guidance (the first with suction and second
 without suction).  The material from the first pass was evaluated by on-site
 cytology team and was deemed adequate. The second sample was sent in cytolyte,
 as advised by cytology.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  No immediate post-procedure
 complications were noted.

 The attending radiologist, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2916**] [**Name (STitle) 2917**] was present and supervised the

 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2116-3-19**].

 FINDINGS:  Since the study from approximately one hour prior, there has been
 placement of a right-sided central venous catheter whose tip terminates
 slightly above the cavoatrial junction.  There is unchanged positioning of the
 endotracheal tube whose tip terminates approximately 4 cm from the carina. The
 nasogastric tube and VP shunt catheter are unchanged. There is slight
 prominence of the pulmonary vasculature; however, this is likely due to low
 lung volumes. There is minimal pleural thickening along the right lateral
 pleura, and there is minimal left basilar atelectasis. Otherwise, the lungs
 are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged.  There are old
 multiple right-sided rib fractures which are chronic."
742,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG with question of sternal click heard.  Evaluate
 sternal wire and position.

 FINDINGS:  Compared with [**2121-3-1**], the sternal wires are unchanged in position
 and intact.  These also appear unchanged compared with the prior postoperative
 film of [**2-26**].

 There are now bilateral right greater than left pleural effusions with CHF.
 There is left lower lobe atelectasis.  The tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter
 remains at the level of the PA bifurcation."
743,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  53 year old female with small bowel obstruction status post
 exploratory laparotomy.  PICC line required for long-term antibiotics.

 PROCEDURE:  The procedure was described to the patient and informed consent
 was obtained.  Access was gained into the right basilic vein under son[**Name (NI) 211**]
 guidance as no superficial veins were palpable.  A 4 French single lumen PICC
 was then advanced over a guidewire and trimmed to appropriate length.  A X-ray
 obtained following placement documents the tip at the distal superior vena
 cava.  The line is ready for immediate use."

745,"FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, large O2 requirement.

 REFERENCE EXAM:  [**2121-1-4**]

 FINDINGS:

 The heart size continues to be moderately enlarged.  There are bilateral
 moderate right and small left effusions that are probably unchanged.  There
 continues to be perihilar haze, vascular redistribution and indistinct
 vasculature consistent with pulmonary edema.  The parenchymal infiltrate on
 the left is slightly decreased, and on the right is not significantly changed.
 Compared to the prior study, overall there has been no significant change in
 pulmonary edema."
746,"IMPRESSION:  The dominant nodule on the right side is benign by ultrasound
 criteria, most consistent with a macrofollicular lesion.  However, in view of
 the size, fine-needle aspiration was felt to be reasonable."
747,"IMPRESSION: Minimal reticular opacities in the right base most likely post
 inflammatory of post infectious scarring. If pulmonary function test shows
 restrictive physiology, repeat limited HRCT in several months can be
 considered to fully exclude chronic interstitial lung disease."

 femoral, and popliteal arteries demonstrate monophasic waveforms in all imaged
 arteries without evidence of occlusion. The peak flow measures 80-90 cm/sec in
 the CFA and 20-25 cm/sec in the SFA. Given the monophasic waveforms and

 INDICATION:  Recent sternotomy with new chest trauma, assess for anterior rib
 fracture and mediastinal hematoma.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained prior to and in arterial
 phase after the administration of intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal
 reformations as well as bilateral oblique reformations were prepared.

 COMPARISONS:  Coronary CTA, [**2190-2-3**].

 FINDINGS:  Thyroid gland is normal in appearance.  Mediastinal calcifications
 likely reflect calcified lymph nodes which in conjunction with calcified
 granulomas in the lungs are likely reflective of prior granulomatous disease.

 COMPARISONS:  CT head from an outside hospital, [**2195-7-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contagious axial MDCT images were obtained through the brain
 without the administration of IV contrast.  Subsequently, rapid axial imaging
 was obtained through the brain after the administration of intravenous
 contrast per the CTA protocol.  Sagittal and coronal MIP reformations were
 obtained.  On a separate workstation, volume-rendered reformats, maximum
 intensity projections, and 3D images were created and reviewed.

 FINDINGS:

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT:  There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass
 effect, or infarction.  The ventricles and sulci are normal in size and

 a gastrojejunostomy tube for aspiration prophyllaxis.

 RADIOLOGISTS: Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 737**] [**Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (LF) 325**], [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2742**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4496**], and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 629**]
 [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 884**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 325**], Staff Radiologist, was present throughout the
 procedure.

 CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%, in stomach and [**Last Name (un) **]. IV
 conscious sedation with divided doses (total 1 mg) of Versed intravenously
 under continuous hemodynamic monitoring.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS: The procedure was described to the patient's
 next of [**Doctor First Name **] and informed consent obtained. The previously-placed 14-French
 pigtail catheter, with the tip in the gastric antrum, was removed over a 0.035
 Super Stiff Amplatz wire, and a 5-French sheath was then passed over the wire
 such that its distal tip was in the antrum of the stomach. A 5-French multi-
 side-hole catheter was then advanced over the wire, and the wire was exchanged
 for a 0.035 angled Glidewire. With the image intensifier in a steep left
 anterior oblique plane, several attempts were made to pass through the post-
 pyloric region using the Glidewire and with the aid of the catheter, but were
 unsuccessful. The catheter was then exchanged for a 5-French [**Doctor Last Name 1408**] II
 catheter, again unsuccessfully. A 5-French [**Location (un) 4398**] catheter was then used in
 conjunction with the angled Glidewire, and were both manipulated well into the
 jejunum beyond the ligament of Treitz. The wire was then removed, and replaced
 with the 0.035 Amplatz Super Stiff wire. Both the catheter and 5-French sheath
 were then removed, and a 14-French peel-away sheath was advanced over the
 Amplatz Super Stiff wire into the post-pyloric region. A 14-French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**]
 gastrojejunostomy catheter was then placed through the peel-away sheath
 following removal of the inner dilator. The sheath was simultaneously removed.
 The pigtail mechanism was then formed in the third portion of the duodenum,
 and the tip placed well into the jejunum. A gastrojejunostogram was then

 HISTORY:  40-year-old male with fall on to tree trunk 45 feet from ground.
 Patient with abdominal pain and nausea.

 COMPARISON:  Trauma chest radiograph performed at 4:04 p.m.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial imaging was performed through the chest, abdomen and
 pelvis after administration of 130 mL of IV Optiray.  Multiplanar reformatted
 images were then obtained.

 CT CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The heart and great vessels appear intact.  No
 pericardial or pleural effusion is seen.  Aside from dependent atelectasis,
 the lungs appear clear.  No pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is seen.  No
 lymphadenopathy is noted.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is free fluid of intermediate density in
 the perihepatic and perisplenic spaces as well as along both paracolic
 gutters.  In addition slightly higher density fluid is noted within the
 mesentery in the mid-to-lower abdomen, between loops of small bowel.  These
 findings are consistent with mesenteric injury and concerning for small bowel
 injury.  No free air is noted within the abdomen.

 The liver, gallbladder and pancreas appear intact.  Small linear hypolucency
 in the posterior spleen is noted, and while this may represent a grade 1
 laceration of the spleen, this could also represent a splenic cleft; a
 laceration of this size within the spleen would not account for the extent of
 hemoperitoneum.

 CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is mild cardiomegaly.  The
 pulmonary arteries are patent without evidence of filling defects to suggest
 pulmonary embolism.  The pericardium and great vessels are unremarkable. There
 is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  There is minimal
 dependent atelectasis.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There are no pleural
 or pericardial effusions.  Visualized portions of the upper abdomen are

 HISTORY:  Choanal atresia

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.

 FINDINGS:
 There is no evidence of bony or membranous choanal atresia.  The choanae are
 both patent.  The sinuses are hypoplastic, as is expected for this age. The
 limited views of the brain show no gross abnormality.

 There is poor visualization of the cribriform plate, which is likely due to
 the  technique of this head CT scam.  If there is any suspicion for an
 encephalocele, we would recommend obtaining an MRI with sedation, or a direct
 coronal head CT with a higher resolution."
880,"IMPRESSION: Continued findings suggestive of asymmetric pulmonary edema. An
 underlying pneumonia in the right lung cannot be excluded."
881,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATIONS:  The patient is a 79-year-old male status post bilateral internal
 carotid artery stents.  Please evaluate for restenosis.

 FINDINGS:  B-mode images on the right show typical stent architecture with
 narrowing as the stent transitions into the internal carotid artery.  The
 common carotid artery waveform is within normal limits and has a peak systolic
 velocity of 61 cm/sec.  In the internal carotid artery, the velocities are
 86/25 with some mild spectral broadening.  The external velocity is 90 cm/sec.
 The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.4.  By velocity criteria, this would correlate with a
 1-39% stenosis.

 On the left, the stent architecture is appreciated.  The common carotid
 portion of the stent does not appear to completely meet the vessel wall.  The
 common carotid artery waveform is within normal limits and has a peak systolic
 velocity of 45 cm/sec.  The internal velocities are 99/33 with some spectral
 broadening.  The external velocity is 124.  The ICA/CCA ratio is 2.2.  By
 velocity criteria, this would correlate with a 1-39% stenosis.

 Both vertebral arteries have antegrade, monophasic flow."
882,"IMPRESSION:
 A 3.5 mm aneurysm with wide neck is noted at th origin of the left posterior
 communicating artery.

 These findings were immediately discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 35453**], the referring

883,"HISTORY:  A 73-year-old male with history of thyroid cancer and dyspnea.

 COMPARISON:  MRI dated [**2121-5-15**], PET/CT [**2121-6-6**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous helical acquisition through the neck was performed with
 intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittally reformatted images were created.

 FINDINGS:  There is diffuse increased  soft tissue attenuation within the soft
 tissues of the right neck, located posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid
 muscle, encircling the right carotid artery, which is patent.  The right
 inferior jugular vein is not visualized, likely secondary to thrombosis. There
 is reconstitution of the superior aspect of the internal jugular vein at the
 level of the superior hyoid bone, from the right branches of the external
 jugular vein.  Also noted is a moderate sized hypodense area deep to the
 sternocleidomastoid, which may represent either the thrombosed internal
 jugular vein versus a necrotic lymph node.
 The abnormal area of soft tissue attenuation within the right neck extends
 inferiorly into the superior mediastinum surrounding the innominate artery and
 abutting the right aspect of the left common carotid and subclavian arteries,
 all of which are patent.  It also extends around the trachea. No focal
 enhancement is noted. A stent is identified within the trachea extending from
 the subglottic airway to the superior mediastinum.  Secretions are noted
 within the trachea below the level of the stent.  The esophagus is patulous in
 appearance and appears to have a large diverticulum extending to the right of
 midline (2:80).  Normal appearing thyroid gland is noted on the right. On the
 left, the superior aspect of the thyroid is identified.

 There is medialization of the right vocal cord, causing narrowing of the
 airway at this level. Also noted is enlargement of the right ventricle,
 consistent with right vocal cord paralysis. The abnormal soft tissue
 attenuation extends to the region of the right vocal cord, and tumor invasion
 cannot be excluded.

 The osseous structures are intact.  Multilevel degenerative changes noted
 throughout the cervical spine with partial fusion of vertebral body C5 and C6.
 Well-circumscribed lytic lesions are noted within the C3, C4, vertebral
 bodies. seen on prior PET/CT without evidence of abnormal FDG uptake.  No
 additional suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified.  There is a
 mucus retention cyst within the left maxillary sinus.  The lung apices reveal

 ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia was provided with injection of 1% lidocaine to
 the posterior soft tissues overlying the spinal access point.  No IV sedation
 or pain medication was administered, per the request of the primary team.
 However, due to extreme patient discomfort, a total of 50 mcg fentanyl and 1
 mg Versed was administered following the procedure.

 The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed on the
 fluoroscopic table in prone position.  Access to the lumbar subarachnoid space
 was obtained at the level of L3-4.  20 and 18 gauge needles were used for
 access under local anesthesia, using 1% lidocaine and with aseptic
 precautions.  Average measured CSF pressure was 15.  Due to severe patient
 discomfort and low flow of CSF, only two 5 cc tubes were filled, with trace
 fluid in tube 3."

 There is a left subclavian line with tip in the proximal SVC, without
 pneumothorax.  Lung volumes are low.  Patient is status post sternotomy. There
 is mild vascular prominence, which may be related to low lung volumes or
 reflect mild CHF. There is a small amount of fluid in the minor fissure, but
 no large effusion is seen.  There are no focal areas of consolidation."

 FINDINGS:  Single AP supine study, comparison [**2197-4-26**], is suboptimal
 secondary to patient's inability to stay still.  Support apparatus positions
 are unchanged, endotracheal tube is 4 cm above carina, left subclavian
 terminates at brachiocephalic confluence, and nasogastric tube terminates
 below scope of study but traverses the left hemidiaphragm.  A small right
 pleural effusion is not significantly changed and an apparent left pleural
 effusion is now moderate sized.  Left hemithorax is poorly evaluated secondary
 to costophrenic angle off radiographic plate.  Multiple healed right rib

925,"FINAL REPORT
 MEDICAL HISTORY:  70-year-old man with thyroid and esophageal cancer needing
 chemotherapy.  The patient is known to have difficult venous access and IV
 team could only place a midline catheter as the wire could not be advanced
 centrally.  As the patient needs central access for chemotherapy, a request
 was placed for IR-guided exchange or placement of a new PICC line with tip
 positioned centrally.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] performed the procedure.  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4100**] [**Name (STitle) 4101**], the
 attending radiologist, reviewed the study.

 ANESHTESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A verbal consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure and risks involved to the patient.  The left upper arm including the
 existing midline catheter was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.
 A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 Initial scout image of the left upper arm was obtained demonstrating a midline
 catheter with tip terminating just distal to the axilla.  Attempts to either
 aspirate blood or to flush through either port of the catheter were
 unsuccessful.  A 0.018 guidewire was placed through one of the ports, but the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of the axilla.  At this stage, a
 small amount of contrast was injected through one of the ports demonstrating
 the catheter to be extravascular.  Therefore, the catheter was removed.  A new
 access was obtained into a left brachial vein with a micropuncture set and
 ultrasound images were stored before and after gaining intravenous access.  A
 0.018 guidewire was placed through the micropuncture sheath, but again the
 wire could not be advanced past the level of axilla.  Therefore, a small
 amount of contrast was injected demonstrating patent but tortuous veins at the
 level of axilla.  A 0.035 Glidewire was placed through the micropuncture
 sheath and advanced easily past this level into SVC.  A 5 French Kumpe
 catheter was placed over the Glidewire and the wire exchanged for a 0.018 PICC
 line wire.  The Kumpe catheter was removed and a peel-away sheath was placed
 over the guidewire and a 5 French double-lumen PICC line measuring 55 cm in
 length was placed through the peel-away sheath with the tip positioned in the
 SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.  The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then
 removed.  A fluoroscopic spot chest film was obtained and stored digitally.
 The catheter was secured to skin with a Stat-Lock device and sterile dressings
 were applied.  Both ports of the catheter were easily aspirated and flushed.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications."

 COMPARISON:  CT torso [**2170-6-28**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine were obtained before and
 after administration of contrast per department protocol.

 MRI THORACIC SPINE:  There is mild loss of height of T11 vertebral body with
 abnormal signal intensity and enhancement along the superior endplate likely
 represents compression fracture.  There is no pre- or para-vertebral hematoma
 or soft tissue component seen.   Vertebral cortex is intact, no retropulsion
 seen.  Posterior elements show normal signal intensities.  Distal thoracic
 vertebrae appear normal in height, marrow signal intensity and alignment.
 Degenerative endplate changes are seen at T8-T9 levels anteriorly. Thoracic
 spinal cord shows normal morphology and signal intensity.  There is no spinal
 canal or neural foraminal narrowing seen.  Pre- and para-vertebral soft
 tissues appear unremarkable.

 MRI LUMBAR SPINE:  The lumbar vertebrae are normal in height and marrow signal
 intensity.  There is grade 1 anterolisthesis at L4-L5 level.  The spinal cord
 terminates at L1-L2 disc level.  Conus medullaris and cauda equina have normal
 morphology and signal intensity.  There is no abnormal enhancement seen in the
 lumbar spine.

 At L3-L4, there is mild disc bulge, ligamentum flavum thickening and facet
 joint osteophytes, but no significant spinal canal or neural foraminal

 alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained.
 Preprocedure timeout was performed confirming the patient identity, site, and
 side of the procedure to be performed.

 After standard sterile prep and local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine, an
 18-gauge spinal needle was advanced into the left hip joint under intermittent
 fluoroscopic guidance.  No free aspirate could be obtained.  Intra-articular
 position was confirmed with a 4 mL Optiray 240 contrast.  10 mL of sterile
 saline was injected into the left hip joint and immediately re-aspirated
 yielding approximately 2.0 mL of clear fluid.  Samples were for requested
 analysis.

 The needle was removed, hemostasis achieved, and a dry sterile bandage was
 applied.

 Comparison made to a prior CT of the sinuses dated [**2140-10-7**].

 FINDINGS:  There is persistent pneumocephalus seen along the anterior frontal
 convexities.  Given that the pneumocephalus has persisted since the prior
 study on [**10-7**], the finding is of concern for perhaps a connection of
 the intracranial structures with the sinuses.  There is a small discontinuity
 of the inner plate of the frontal sinus, which could perhaps represent a
 connection.  However, better evaluation of this could be performed with a
 facial CT scan, as it has thinner images through the bones of the facial bone.
 There is mild flattening of the sulci caused by the pneumocephalus.  The left
 frontal subdural hematoma has resolved.

 Again seen are the postoperative changes from prior craniotomy as well as
 surgical fixation plates for correction of the frontal bone fractures.

 The frontal sinuses are persistently opacified.  There is moderate mucosal
 thickening of the ethmoid air cells.  There is also mucosal thickening
 involving the inferior aspect of the maxillary sinus with perhaps small polyps
 or mucous retention cyst.  The subcutaneous emphysema has resolved.  No new

 time-of-flight MRV of the head.  Three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA of the
 head.  Dynamic contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MRA of the neck.

 FINDINGS:

 HEAD MRI:  There is no acute infarction.  There are multiple foci of T2
 hyperintensity at the [**Doctor Last Name 107**]/white matter junction of the cerebral hemispheres
 bilaterally, as well as foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter of both
 cerebral hemispheres, without associated contrast enhancement or mass effect.
 Similar lesions are also seen in both cerebellar hemispheres.  These are
 congruent with the history of previous thromboembolic infarctions.  There is
 no evidence of associated blood products.  The ventricles and sylvian fissures
 are slightly prominent for the patient's age, suggestive of volume loss.
 There is no evidence of white matter edema or other changes to suggest PRES.

 There is a small subretinal or subchoroidal collection in the lateral aspect
 of the right lobe, most likely a hematoma, with associated retinal detachment.
 The left globe is unremarkable.

 Prominence of the pituitary gland is normal in the postpartum setting.

 HEAD MRV:  Flow is not visualized in the posterior aspect of the superior
 sagittal sinus or in the straight sinus.  Flow is visualized in the anterior
 aspect of the superior sagittal sinus, and in the transverse sinuses.  There
 is no evidence of a filling defect in the superior sagittal sinus on the
 post-contrast images of the conventional MRI, suggesting that the MRV findings
 could be artifactual.

 HEAD MRA:  Flow is visualized in the intracranial internal carotid and
 vertebral arteries, and their major branches, without evidence of stenoses or
 aneurysms.

 NECK MRA:  There is a normal configuration of the aortic arch.  Evaluation of
 the nondominant right vertebral artery is technically limited.  There is no

 without IV contrast.

 MR OF THE HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  Diffusion weighted images again
 demonstrate two distinct areas of restricted diffusion within the left pons.
 There is a separate focus of restricted diffusion within the left cerebellar
 hemisphere.  In comparison with the prior study, the cerebellar and medial
 pontine lesions have become less intense.  No new areas of restricted
 diffusion are identified.  Within the left basal ganglia is a region of high
 T2 signal surrounded by a dark rim on susceptibility images.  This appearance

 HISTORY:  35-year-old man with history of recent IVDU, presented with abrupt
 onset of chills on [**2134-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT torso with oral and IV contrast with coronal and sagittal
 reformats.  Please note that no peripheral IV line was available and contrast
 was injected through right femoral line (injected by the radiologist).

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph [**2134-4-16**], and CT pelvis [**2134-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT CHEST:  The airways are patent up to subsegmental level.  There are
 bibasilar opacities at the lung bases, could be partially atelectasis, cannot
 exclude aspiration.  There are bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities in
 the lungs, predominantly in the left upper lobe concerning for multifocal
 pneumonia in appropriate clinical setting.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pericardial effusion.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is increased
 number; however, no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum,
 hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria.  There is slightly prominent
 lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region (2:16); nonspecific, could be
 reactive.

 CT ABDOMEN:  Due to hand injection of iv contrast, the timing of contrast
 bolus is suboptimal.  With this limitation in mind, the liver is of normal
 size.  There is a possible fatty liver.  There is no intra- or extra-hepatic
 biliary duct dilatation.  The gallbladder, pancreas and spleen appear within
 normal limits. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  The kidneys enhance
 symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of
 hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  There is a 3.3 x 3.2 cm cystic
 lesion in the interpolar region of the left kidney with punctate
 calcifications dependently, likely small stones, (2:68).

 There is no evidence of bowel obstruction.  The appendix is normal (2:115).
 There are multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitneum; however, they are not
 pathologically enlarged according to CT size criteria.

 CT PELVIS:  There is moderate amount of stool in the rectum and sigmoid.  The
 urinary bladder contains a Foley catheter and focus of air, presumably from
 recent instrumentation, however, correlate with symptoms.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles are normal.  There is a small amount of free fluid in the
 pelvis (2:126-127).  The visualized loops of small bowel and pelvis appear
 normal.  There is a right femoral line.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions. There is focus
 of air and contrast in the left hip from recent intervention.

 SOFT TISSUE:  No evidence of subcutaneous free air in the imaged portion of
 the soft tissue.  Please note that part of the soft tissue of the right pelvis
 was not imaged due to patient body habitus."
953,IMPRESSION:  No evidence of malignancy.  BIRADS 1 - negative.
954,"IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval reduction in size of pneumoperitoneum and subcutaneous emphysema.
 2.  No evidence of bowel obstruction to explain the patient's worsening
 abdominal pain.
 3.  Stable bilateral small pleural effusions.

 Clinical correlation recommended.
 5.  Severe atherosclerotic disease with eccentric mural atheroma of the
 abdominal aorta."
955,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: Assess PICC catheter placement.

 PORTABLE CHEST: Comparison is made to prior study dated [**2196-11-8**].
 The previously noted central line has been removed. There is a new right-sided
 PICC catheter, with its tip malpositioned, directed cephalad in the right
 internal jugular vein (the tip of the catheter is off the film). Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable and the lungs appear clear. There is no
 pneumothorax."
956,"FINAL REPORT
 CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS [**2178-2-26**].

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  83 year old woman with mental status changes and sepsis.
 Now with abdominal pain.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 lung bases to the pubic symphysis after the administration of 145 cc of
 Optiray contrast.  Optiray was used per history of allergies.

 No prior studies available for comparison.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  Small pleural effusions are noted
 bilaterally.  There is associated opacification of the dependent lower lobes
 bilaterally which most likely represents atelectasis.  The liver, spleen,
 pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and ureters are unremarkable.  The
 gallbladder is distended with an edematous wall and adjacent stranding of the
 fat.  There are no gallstones seen within the gallbladder or along the course
 of the cystic or common bile ducts.  There is a small amount of free fluid
 tracking along the right paracolic gutter.  There are no pathologically
 enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen and there is no free air.

 CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a small amount of free fluid in
 the pelvis.  The uterus and adnexa are unremarkable.  There is no
 lymphadenopathy.  The urinary bladder is decompressed by a Foley catheter.
 Multiple diverticula are noted in the sigmoid and descending colon with no
 changes to suggest diverticulitis.  Mild degenerative changes are noted in the
 lower lumbar spine.  Otherwise, no osseous abnormalities are seen.

 Vascular calcifications are noted through the aorta and splenic artery."

 is persisting, predominantly right-sided alveolar opacity, and prominence of
 the pulmonary vasculature with upper zone redistribution consistent with
 congestive heart failure. Allowing for technique, there are been minimal
 interval change.  Stable cardiomegaly. Persisting bibasilar opacities likely
 due to pleural effusion.  Stable cardiomegaly."
963,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: 66-year-old woman with neutropenic fever.

 COMMENTS: PA and lateral radiographs of the chest are reviewed, and compared
 with the previous study of yesterday.

 cava. No pneumothorax is identified.

 The previously identified faint opacity in the left upper lobe is not seen.
 The lungs are clear. The heart and mediastinum are within normal limit."
964,"IMPRESSION:

 Mild persistent interstitial opacities likely represent mild edema.  Left
 lower lobe pneumonia as seen on the CT from last night.  NG tube is
 appropriate."
965,"FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient intubated due to
 unresponsiveness.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to [**2129-12-21**] obtained at
 02:25 a.m.

 The ET tube tip is approximately 8.3 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip
 passes below the diaphragm with its tip not included in the field of view.
 The right internal jugular line tip is at the cavoatrial junction.  The
 pacemaker leads terminate in right atrium and most likely in the proximal
 portion of the right ventricle.

 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Extensive parenchymal opacities
 seen in the right mid lung and left lower lobe are unchanged as well overlying
 with significant degree of hyperinflation, most likely due to emphysema.
 Thickening of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged and most likely
 chronic as well as apical thickening in the right.

 correlation.

 CHEST:  AP supine portable view.  The right costophrenic angle is not included
 on the image.  The nasogastric tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and the endotracheal
 tube remain in unchanged, satisfactory positions.  A left chest tube and
 mediastinal drain also remain present.  The crescentic opacity in the right
 upper and lateral hemithorax appears unchanged.  Volume loss in the right
 hemithorax, with shift of the heart and mediastinum to the right, remains
 present.  Correlation with the chest CT of the same day confirms that the
 opacity in question corresponds to right upper lobe collapse, rather than
 pleural effusion or extrapleural hematoma.  Small dependent bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.  Minor linear atelectasis at the left lung base is
 unchanged.  There is no pulmonary edema.  Evidence of CABG is again noted.

 surgical clips are again seen.  A NG tube is present with the tip in the
 distal antrum vs. proximal duodenum.  There is a fullness in the mediastinal
 contour, which likely is due to fullness in the right hilum.  The aorta is
 also slightly unfolded. The pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits. No
 pleural effusions are present.  No focal consolidations are present to suggest
 pneumonia.  The osseous structures are unchanged."
968,"FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION:  Perivascular calcifications identified throughout
 the foot. There is no evidence for acute fractures/dislocations.  Within the
 medial aspect of the medial cuneiform, near the first tarsometatarsal joint,
 there is a focal area of lucency which may be projectional.  No definite
 cortical breakthrough or periosteal reaction is identified.  However, there is
 no air within the adjacent soft tissues.  Would correlate with pain within
 this region.  The rest of the bony structures demonstrate no definite evidence
 for acute osteomyelitis.

 INDICATION:  Car vs. tree.

 COMPARISONS:  None. Reference made to several axial images from outside CT
 scan.

 TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast cervical spine CT.

 FINDINGS:  Vertebral bodies are normal in height and alignment. No
 prevertebral soft tissue swelling is seen.  On the sagittal reconstructions
 only, is a lucency through the right superior facet of C7 and posterior
 elements of left T1. While this extends through the cortex on the sagittal
 reconstructions, this lucency is not visible on the coronal or axial raw data
 and is not felt to represent acute fracture.  There is congenital nonfusion of
 the C1 ring posteriorly. Lateral masses articulate normally with the odontoid
 process. There is no atlanto- axial subluxation. Visualized portions of the

991,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  84-year-old man with emphysema, atrial fibrillation and
 urosepsis.  Requesting placement of PICC for antibiotics.

 OPERATORS:  Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 730**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 501**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 411**] [**Doctor Last Name 412**].

 PROCEDURES:
 1.  Post-pyloric tube placement.
 2.  PICC line placement.

 POST-PYLORIC TUBE PLACEMENT:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite
 and placed supine upon the table.  A scout view of the neck and chest
 demonstrates a Dobbhoff tube terminating in the stomach.  An initial attempt
 was made to place a wire through the Dobbhoff tube, however, given its
 thickness, it could not be exchanged for separate catheters.  As such, the
 Dobbhoff two and wire were removed and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1213**]-[**Doctor First Name 948**] feeding tube was
 placed via the left naris with internal wire which were easily extended down
 beyond the pylorus, with the tip terminating just prior to the ligament of
 Treitz.  The wire was removed and contrast injected, confirming this location.
 A final fluoroscopic view of the abdomen was obtained.  There were no
 immediate complications.

 PICC LINE PLACEMENT:  The patient's right arm was prepped and draped in
 standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout and huddle were performed
 per standard [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.

 TECHNIQUE:  Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the right brachial
 vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set.
 Hard copies of ultrasound images were obtained before and immediately after
 establishing intravenous access.  A peel-away sheath was then placed over a
 guidewire and a double lumen PICC line measuring 39 cm in length was then
 placed through the peel-away sheath with its terminating in the cavoatrial
 junction.  Position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film
 of the chest.

 The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed.  The catheter was
 secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied.
 The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no immediate
 complications."

 ABDOMEN CT W/O CONTRAST:  At the lung bases, there are large pleural effusions
 and associated atelectasis bilaterally.  A small amount of pericardial fluid
 is also present.

 The gallbladder appears dense, which is suggestive of sludge.  If clinically
 indicated, further evaluation by ultrasound may be performed.  The liver,
 spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys are unremarkable.  There is no
 free air, free fluid or hematoma.  No lymphadenopathy is identified within the
 mesentery or retroperitoneum.

 PELVIC CT W/O CONTRAST: Multiple diverticula are present throughout the colon,
 without evidence of diverticulitis.  There is retained contrast within the
 colon from a prior study, probably a barium enema.  The small bowel is
 unremarkable.  Calcifications are present within the prostate.  There is a

 INDICATION: Unresponsive woman, question meningitis.

 Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images of the brain are obtained. T1 axial and
 coronal images were performed before and after gadolinium administration.
 Limited MR of the intracranial circulation was obtained.

 Over all examination was degraded by motion artifact. There is minimally
 increased T2 signal within the anterior portion of the temporal lobes. This
 abnormality could not be duplicated on T2 or susceptibility images. There is
 no significant focal effacement. Diffuse mild meningeal enhancement is seen
 following contrast administration suggestive of meningitis. Ventricular system
 is symmetrical. There is no vasogenic edema.

 Limited MRA of the intracranial circulation reveals slighlty hypoplastic
 basilar artery which would be developmentally major. There are no major
 intracranial vascular occlusions. Note is made of fetal origin to the
 posterior cerebral arteries."

 INDICATION:  85-year-old woman status post resection of left facial tumor,
 persistently tachycardic, desats to 80s on room air, rule out PE.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST TECHNIQUE: Multidetector scanning
 is performed from the thoracic inlet through the diaphragm prior to and during
 dynamic injection of 100 cc of Optiray.

 No prior studies are available for comparison.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is no axillary,
 mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The pulmonary arteries are well
 opacified.  There are no filling defects.  A small left pleural effusion is
 identified.  There is atelectasis in the right lower lobe.  There is left
 lower lobe consolidation.  A small amount of pericardial fluid is noted. There
 are no lung nodules or masses.  An NG tube is identified.

 Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate a normal gallbladder, liver,
 and spleen.  A 1.2 cm nodule in the left adrenal gland measures 16 Hounsfield
 units, is thus indeterminate but most consistent with an adenoma.  A 3.5 cm

 Dynamic blood pool images shows a focus of rounded radiotracer activity midline
 below the aortic bifurcation occuring at the start of dynamic imaging.  Although
 this activity appears to move about in the over several centimeters, it remains
 unchanged in size and does not disperse over the course of 1 hour and 41
 minutes.  The location along the bowel cannot be determined.  This may represent
 a focal region of blood contained within a diverticulum, however remains

 evaluation of intra-abdominal organs.  The liver is noted with a geographic
 hypodensity in segment V, incompletely assessed, but grossly unchanged
 compared to the study 7 days ago.  There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal
 dilatation.  The gallbladder is noted with small amount of hyperdense material
 layering in the dependent portion, compatible with gallstone.  There is no CT
 evidence of acute cholecystitis.  The adrenal glands, pancreas and spleen is
 grossly unremarkable.  The splenic vein is markedly calcified.

 Bilateral hydroureteronephrosis is moderate-to-severe but relatively unchanged
 in severity compared to prior.  The stomach, duodenum and proximal loops of
 small bowel are grossly unremarkable.  There is free oral contrast passage
 through and reaching up to the mid descending colon.  There is no free air or
 air in the intra-abdominal cavity.

 CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is marked interval increase and spread
 of subcutaneous air along the left posterolateral pelvic wall, compatible with
 interval aggressive necrosis of the underlying soft tissues.  Hyperdense
 material is noted among the necrosis, most conspicuous in images 2:62-64,
 concerning for extraluminal oral contrast from fistulization of the adjacent
 bowel.  Scattered pockets of tiny free air along the adjacent bowel loop, also
 suggestive of microperforation.  There is no definite bowel obstruction.
 Colostomy is again noted in the left lower quadrant.  The large collection of
 soft tissue and fluid is again noted in the mid pelvis, amorphous and
 difficult to assess the boundary.  The asymmetrically enlarged left psoas
 muscle, incompletely evaluated without IV contrast, either represent an
 intramuscular mass or abscess.

 BONE WINDOW:  There is no definite bony erosion.  No suspicious lytic or
 sclerotic lesions are noted."
1041,"FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Epigastric pain radiating to the back.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases through
 the pubic symphysis without intravenous contrast.

 Comparison: [**2101-5-18**]

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The visualized lung bases demonstrate
 large bilateral pleural effusions and compression atelectasis. These have
 increased in size as compared to the prior study. Pacer wires are noted. There
 is no pericardial effusion. Allowing for the limitations of a non-contrast
 examination, the liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and right kidney are
 normal. There is a 1 cm low attenuation focus within the left kidney, which
 most likely represents a small cyst. Stomach and proximal loops of small and
 large bowel are unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or
 mesenteric lymph nodes are identified. There is no free fluid within
 the abdomen. Specifically, there is no evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
 Note is made of vicarious contrast excretion through the gallbladder.

 CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder, distal ureters,
 and prostate gland are grossly normal. A few coarse calcifications are
 visualized within the prostate gland. There is old inspissated contrast
 material within numerous sigmoid diverticula. There is no evidence of
 diverticulitis. There is no free fluid in the abdomen.

 Bone windows:  No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified."
1042,"IMPRESSION:

 1) Distended gallbladder with wall thickening and adjacent stranding
 suggestive of cholecystitis. Ultrasound wouldbe helpful in excluding stone
 disease as an etiology. The house staff caring for the patient was immediately

 Technical Information:
 After a timing bolus acquisition, retrospectively cardiac gated contrast
 enhanced 64-slice coronary CTA was performed.  3D images were obtained and
 reviewed.  CT-cine images were reviewed to assess left ventricular systolic
 function.  Metoprolol and nitroglycerin were given prior to image acquisition.


 Findings:
 Structure and Function
 The myocardium appeared to have homogenous signal intensity without evidence
 of abnormal perfusion.  The pericardial thickness was normal.  The diameters
 of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal.  The main
 pulmonary artery diameter was normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was mildly
 increased.
 The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was moderately increased.  The
 end-diastolic volume was moderately increased.  The calculated left
 ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 65% with normal regional systolic
 function.  The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal.
 The left ventricular mass was normal.

 Coronary Imaging
 	CT coronary angiography revealed an anomalous origin of a dominant right
 coronary artery from the pulmonary artery.  The right coronary artery was
 increased in size but not aneurismal.  The origin and orientation of the left
 main coronary artery was normal.   The left main was increased in size but not
 aneurismal.  The left main trifurcated into the LAD, LCx and ramus intermedius
 without evidence of disease.  The LAD was increased in size but not
 aneurismal, with large septal branches and multiple bridging collaterals to
 the right coronary artery.  The LAD had 1 diagonal branch and was free of
 disease.  The LCx had 1 OM branch and was free of disease.  The calcium score
 was 0.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  43-year-old man with chest pain, drug use history,
 questionable history of trauma.  Please evaluate for pneumonia and chest wall
 trauma.

 COMPARISON:  [**2190-9-3**].

 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Minimal right base scarring is once again
 seen, however the remainder of the lungs are clear. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unremarkable.  The patient is status post median sternotomy.  No
 pleural effusions or pneumothoraces are seen."
1049,"FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  C-spine fracture. Pre-op.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the cervical spine were obtained and sagittal and
 coronal reformatted images were created.

 CT CERVICAL SPINE:  Again seen is a type 2 fracture of the dens.  There is no
 evidence of displacement.  There is disc space narrowing at multiple levels,
 most severe at C5-6 and C6-7.   There is posterior spurring at the C6 level
 and central canal narrowing at this level.  No other fractures are identified.
 The overall alignment of the cervical vertebral bodies is within normal
 limits.  There is no significant prevertebral soft tissue swelling.  Several
 small, subcentimeter lymph nodes are seen within the neck bilaterally."
1050,"IMPRESSION:  Unchanged mild pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar atelectasis, left
 worse than right."
1051,"IMPRESSION:  1) Unchanged large hiatal hernia.
 2) Single loop of non-dilated small bowel, containing enteric contrast, shows
 slight wall thickening and surrounding fat stranding.  These findings are
 nonspecific.  No evidence of small bowel obstruction or diverticulitis."
1052,"IMPRESSION: 1) A PICC line has a straighter than normal course over its distal
 aspect. Although this may represent straightening by the catheter wire,
 extravascular location of this catheter cannot be excluded and a repeat
 radiograph once the wire has been withdrawn or partially withdrawn is
 recommended. There is no pneumothorax.
 2) Persistent right middle lung zone opacity consistent with pneumonia.

 Worsening failure."
1053,"FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST:

 REASON FOR EXAM:  New desaturation.

 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.

 Cardiac size is normal.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm but
 likely in the stomach.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the upper SVC.  Left
 transvenous pacemaker lead terminates in unchanged position one in the right
 atrium and the second one could be just at the entrance of the right
 ventricle.  Moderate to large right pleural effusion has minimally increased
 in size.  Right IJ catheter tip in the cavoatrial junction.  Bilateral
 pulmonary enlargement is stable.  The lungs are hyperinflated due to
 emphysema.  Right apical opacity likely related with past tuberculosis and
 fibrotic changes is stable.  Left apical pleural thickening is also stable.
 Asymmetric opacification of the lungs that is mild, greater on the right side
 has increased on the right mid lung and suggest a new area of infectious
 process.  Otherwise mild edema is stable."
1054,"IMPRESSION:
 1. Splenomegaly with low-attenuation lesions, incompletely characterized, but
 by demographics likely representing a hemangioma.
 2. Malposition of the urethral catheter as described.
 3. High attenuation liver parenchyma likely secondary to amiodarone therapy.
 4. No evidence of a retroperitoneal hematoma.
 5. Airspace opacities and pleural effussions most in keeping with pulmonary
 edema.
 6. Cystic pancreatic lesions requiring further evaluation with MRCP."
1055,"FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess line.

 Comparison is made with prior study performed three hours earlier.

 Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC.  Questionable tiny right apical
 pneumothorax is still probably present; otherwise, there are no acute interval
 changes allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.  Of note,
 pleural effusions are more conspicuous than before."
1056,"INDICATION:  68-year-old status post CABG with abdominal pain.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to abdominal radiograph performed [**2122-11-23**].

 Two frontal radiographs of the abdomen demonstrate a normal bowel gas pattern
 with no evidence of obstruction, free air, or pneumatosis.  Note sternotomy
 suture consistent with history of CABG.  Visualized osseous structures are
 unremarkable."
1057,"IMPRESSION:  Technically successful ultrasound-guided drainage of one liter of
 pleural fluid from the right pleural cavity.  Thoracentesis limited to one
 liter to prevent re-expansion pulmonary edema, as the patient had some mild
 coughing during the thoracentesis."
1058,"FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary congestion.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**11-27**], the outer portion of the
 left lung has been excluded from the image.  Continued large right and

 COMPARISON:  [**2118-7-4**].

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal, newly
 appeared opacity in the left mid lung.  Moreover, subtle opacities have newly
 appeared at the right lung base.  Given that the overall lung volumes have
 decreased, both areas could represent atelectasis.  However, early pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.  Otherwise, the radiograph is unchanged.  Unchanged
 monitoring and support devices.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 pneumothorax, no pleural effusions."

 INDICATION:  Status post MVC, with right-sided pain.  Evaluate for fracture,
 internal injury.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis.  Multiplanar reconstructions were
 performed.

 CONTRAST:  150 cc of IV Optiray contrast administered due to the rapid rate of
 bolus injection required for this study.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Soft tissue window images demonstrate no
 mediastinal fluid or pneumomediastinum.  The vascular structures are intact,
 without any evidence of injury.  The heart and pericardium are normal in
 appearance.  No pleural effusions are seen.  Lung window images demonstrate no
 parenchymal consolidation or pulmonary nodules.  The airways are patent to the
 level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a linear area of decreased
 attenuation within segments V, VI and VIII of the liver, consistent with a
 liver laceration.  Additionally, there is a small amount of dense fluid,
 consistent with blood, adjacent to the inferior tip of the spleen, and along
 the anterior surface of the liver.  The portal vein is intact.  The
 gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, and pancreas are within normal
 limits.  No free intra-abdominal air is seen.  The bowel is normal, without
 evidence of bowel wall thickening or dilatation.  No mesenteric free fluid is
 noted.  The vascular structures are intact, without any evidence of periaortic

 MRI/MRA/MRV HEAD

 MRI HEAD:

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1; axial T2, FLAIR, GRE, DWI, DTI of the head were
 obtained.

 PRELIMINARY READ:  ""acute infarct of the right talamus and internal capsule""
 by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59168**].

 Comparison is made to a concurrent CTA/CTV of the head as well as a prior MRI
 of the head from [**2114-9-13**].

 FINDINGS:  There are new small infarcts involving the right thalamus and
 possibly the posterior limb of the right internal capsule.  These infarcts
 show increased T2- and FLAIR signal, which suggests that they are not
 hyperacute.

 There is encephalomalacia and gliosis involving the right frontal lobe and the
 left occipital lobe.  The previously seen large left parietooccipital
 hemorrhage has essentially resolved.  The previously seen intraventricular
 hemorrhage has also resolved.

 There is a moderate subcortical, deep, and periventricular white matter T2
 hyperintensity which likely represent combination of old infarcts and old
 small vessel disease.

 There is gyriform mineralization of the right frontal lobe, left frontal lobe,
 right parietal lobe, and the left occipital lobe.  There is siderosis lining
 the occipital horns of the lateral ventricles bilaterally as well as siderosis
 of the inferior cerebellar hemispheres and brainstem.  Mineralization along a
 right frontal shunt tract is seen.  There is stable old hemorrhage within the
 body of the right lateral ventricle.

 The previously seen left to right shift of the normally midline structures and
 mass effect upon the left lateral ventricle have resolved.  The ventricles are
 normal in size.

 MRA/MRV HEAD:

 TECHNIQUE:  3D time-of-flight images of the intracranial arterial system as
 well as oblique 2D time-of-flight images of the intracranial venous system
 were obtained.

 Comparison is made to a concurrent CTA/CTV of the head as well as prior MRV of
 the head from [**2114-9-13**] and prior CTA/CTV of the head from [**2114-9-3**].

 FINDINGS:  There is new abrupt termination of the right posterior cerebral
 artery at its P2 segment which is new since the prior studies.

 There is decreased signal within the V3 and V4 segments of the vertebral
 arteries bilaterally as well as the proximal portion of the basilar artery,
 not significantly changed since the MR from [**2114-9-13**].  However, the CTA from
 [**2115-1-17**] shows normal enhancement of these arteries and a congenitally
 hypoplastic right vertebral artery.  Therefore, the MRA findings are most
 likely are artifactual or technical, and may relate to the small caliber of
 these vessels.

 The MRV shows no significant change since the prior studies.  There is partial
 thrombosis of the left transverse sinus, left sigmoid sinus, and the left
 internal jugular vein.  There is near complete thrombosis of the superior
 sagittal sinus.  The right internal cerebral vein and basal vein of [**Doctor Last Name 4323**]
 are also at least partially thrombosed."
1073,"IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval decrease in size of the large left pelvic soft tissue mass, which
 encases small bowel and the cecal tip.  The lesion is consistent with
 recurrent ovarian neoplasm, although the imaging appearance of small bowel
 dilatation and mural thickening can also be seen with small bowel involvement
 of lymphoma.

 2.  Small mesenteric lymph nodes in the left lower abdomen have also slightly
 decreased in size.

 3.  Persistent hydronephrosis of the left kidney."

 of [**2178-2-23**].

 FINDINGS: The FLAIR axial images are limited by motion.

 Mild periventricular white matter changes are identified. No evidence of
 midline shift or mass effect is seen. There is prominence of ventricles and
 sulci indicating brain atrophy. There is no evidence of distinct areas of
 increased signal within the temporal lobes although the evaluation is slightly
 limited by motion.

 Gadolinium enhanced images demonstrate no evidence of definite leptomeningeal
 enhancement. No significant pachymeningeal enhancement is identified. No
 evidence of intraaxial abnormal enhancement seen. Vascular flow voids are
 maintained. Bilateral fluid levels are identified within the maxillary sinuses

 and pancreas are unremarkable.  Focal thickening of the left adrenal gland is
 noted.  A 1-cm hypodense lesion is seen in the right kidney (2, 57) likely
 represents a cyst.  Loops of small bowel are normal in caliber and without
 focal wall thickening.  There is no free fluid or free air.

 vertebral basilar junction."
1086,"FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION: Witnessed aspiration event. Status post trauma.

 An endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, and bilateral
 chest tubes remain in place. Of note, the right-sided chest tube has an
 unusual inferior course, with the distal tip projecting adjacent to the right
 12th rib, possibly in the infradiaphragmatic region. A lateral view would be
 necessary to determine whether this is in the lung or below the diaphragm.

 Note is made of a left basilar pneumothorax, which is not clearly seen on the
 previous study. Given the supine position of the patient, this is at least
 moderate in size.

 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in the interval. There is an
 asymmetric bilateral alveolar pattern which affects the right lung to a
 greater degree than the left.

 Overall, the alveolar opacities in the right lung have significantly improved
 when compared to [**2106-9-10**]."

1102,"FINAL REPORT

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    20.3 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2121-6-6**]);
 INDICATION:  Large right thyroid mass, FNA cytology demonstrating squamous
 cells, with worsening dysphagia.

 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 96 mg/dL. The area
 imaged spanned the region from the  orbits to the thighs.

 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake.

 INTERPRETATION:

 HEAD/NECK: A large, lobulated mass with hetergeneous solid and cystic components
 arises from the right thyroid lobe and extends into the superior neck at the
 level of the mandible.  This lesion measures 7.3 cm TV x 5.2 cm AP x 8.2 cm CC,
 with SUVmax of 24.13.   There is severe mass effect on and compression of the
 trachea and esophagus.

 No FDG-avid intracranial lesions are seen in the imaged skull base.

 CHEST:  A long-segment region of circumferential wall thickening up to 1.5 cm is
 present in the mid-to-distal esophagus, with SUVmax of 35.12.  This abnormality
 spans a craniocaudal distance of approximately 9.4 cm, from the level of the
 carina to just above the gastroesophageal junction.

 An upper right paratracheal node measures 1.4 cm, with SUVmax of 17.45.  3-mm
 pulmonary nodule in the anterior right upper lobe is non-FDG-avid.  Thoracic
 aortic and three-vessel coronary artery calcifications are present.

 ABDOMEN/PELVIS:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the abdomen and pelvis.  Dense
 calcifications are present in the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No FDG-avid lesions are seen in the bones and soft tissues.

 Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary glands, GI and  GU
 tracts, liver and spleen."
1103,"IMPRESSION:

 1.  Free fluid in the upper abdomen, with high-density fluid/hematoma in the
 mid abdominal mesentery between loops of bowel.  This is consistent with
 mesenteric injury, and suspicious for small-bowel injury.

 2.  Small linear hypolucency along the posterior aspect of the spleen could
 represent a grade 1 laceration or a splenic cleft; however, if it represents a
 laceration, it does not account for the amount of hemoperitoneum present.

 3.  Indeterminate fracture of the anterior right seventh rib, could be
 chronic.  Otherwise, no evidence for acute fracture or malalignment of the
 spine.

 Findings were discussed with the trauma team and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at 4:50 p.m."

 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior exam, the tip of the right-sided PICC line is
 now seen in the mid right subclavian vein, withdrawn from the right internal
 jugular vein.  With the exception of a slightly poor inspiratory effort, no
 major changes are seen from prior exam.  Note on the current examination is
 made of a deformed neck of the left humerus, likely related to prior healed
 trauma."

 CT C-SPINE:  No evidence of fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine is
 seen. No evidence of hemorrhage adjacent to the cervical spine.  Note is made
 of an ET tube, NG tube as well as a chest tube in the left lung apex.  Air
 fluid levels in the visualized portion of the paranasal sinus, consistent with

 Two frontal views of the skull reveal no radiopaque foreign bodies in relation
 to the orbits.  The patient has hearing aids bilaterally."
1109,"IMPRESSION:  An abnormal focus of increased tracer activity just superior and
 posterior to the right kidney is seen, which could correspond to the spleen.
 Given the history of sudden onset left abdominal pain, splenic infarction could
 be considered.  However, in the most recent cross-sectional imaging of the upper
 abdomen (on prior chest CT), no significant abnormalities were noted in this
 area, and cross-sectional examination of the abdomen such as an abdominal CT
 could be performed for further evaluation of this region and for anatomic
 correlation.  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 45**] on [**2196-9-26**].

 radiologist, Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) 291**], was supervising throughout the examination.

 TECHNIQUE:

 The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were explained to the
 patient, and informed consent was obtained. The patient was transported to the
 neuro-angiography suite and placed on the table in prone position. The lower
 back was prepared and draped in the standard sterile fashion. Timeout was
 performed according to [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.

 The L4 vertebral level was localized with fluoroscopy. 1% lidocaine was
 utilized for local anesthesia. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 22-gauge spinal
 needle was inserted at L4 level at the midline. Spontaneous
 cerebrospinal fluid was obtained and immediately 15 cc of Isovue were
 administered intrathecally. The needle was subsequently removed. The patient
 was transported to the CT scanner for additional evaluation. There were no
 immediate complications.

 SEDATION: 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 2 mg of Versed were given in divided doses
 over total intraservice time of 25 minutes. Cardiorespiratory parameters were
 monitored continuously during the procedure."
1112,"Impression:
 1.  Moderately increased left ventricular cavity size with severe regional
 left ventricular systolic dysfunction.  The LVEF was severely depressed at
 29%.  There was MR evidence of a large, transmural anterior infarct.  The
 findings are consistent with a poor likelihood of functional recovery of these
 walls after mechanical revascularization.

 this level (series 400b, image 35) consistent with penetrating ulcers and
 likely the source for aortic leak given the circumferential hematoma around
 the arch. There is no evidence of aortic pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or
 transection, and no active extravasation is seen at this time. The great
 vessels are patent. The pulmonary arterial tree opacifies well.  The left
 vertebral artery originates directly off the aortic arch between the left
 common carotid and subclavian arteries, an anatomic variant. The trachea and
 airways to the segmental level are patent. There is no evidence of ventricular
 aneurysm or rupture.

 Evaluation of the lungs demonstrates moderate background emphysematous
 changes.  There is mild biapical scarring.  There is a small amount of left
 pleural fluid which measures 30HU, indicating a small hemothorax. Dependent
 atelectasis is mild. There are small areas of smooth pleural thickening of the
 lateral pleura of the right upper and middle lobes, (series 3, image 35).
 There is no pneumothorax.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  A small subcentimeter hypodense focus of
 the right hepatic lobe is too small to characterize.  The gallbladder, spleen,
 and adrenal glands are unremarkable.  The pancreatic duct is top normal in
 caliber.  No obstructing stones are seen.  There is a diverting colostomy in
 the left lower quadrant.  There is herniation of a small amount of
 intraperitoneal fat through the abdominal wall ostomy defect.  There are
 bilateral simple renal cysts, the larger is exophytic on the left measuring
 9.4 cm in diameter.  There is no free gas or fluid within the abdomen.

 There is heavy arthrosclerotic change of the abdominal aorta, which is
 tortuous and ectatic.  Proximal to the aortic bifurcation, the aorta measures
 up to a caliber of 3.2 cm.  The iliac arteries also show heavy atherosclerotic
 change. The origins of the celiac axis, SMA, and [**Female First Name (un) 257**] are calcified; however,
 these vessels and their major branches appear patent.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Numerous brachytherapy seeds are present
 within the prostate gland, which is enlarged.  The urinary bladder is
 distended with contrast.  There is a right inguinal hernia with protrusion of
 a small portion of small bowel, but no evidence of incarceration or
 obstruction.  There is no free pelvic fluid.  There are numerous sigmoid
 diverticula, but no evidence of acute diverticulitis.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Wedge deformity of the L2 vertebral body is probably chronic.
 There is bilateral spondylolysis at L5 with associated grade 1 anterolisthesis
 of L5 over S1."

 FINDINGS:  There has been interval craniotomy through the frontal bone and
 frontal sinuses with surgical fixation plates overlying various craniotomy
 fragments yielding near anatomic alignment of the frontal bone and frontal
 sinuses.  There is a moderate amount of pneumocephalus and subcutaneous
 emphysema, all consistent with post-surgical changes.  There is a small left
 frontal subdural hematoma, slightly larger than prior CT studies from [**10-3**], [**2139**].  There is mild ethmoid sinus mucosal thickening and small right

 COMPARISON:  No previous exams for comparison.

 FINDINGS:  The right kidney measures 10.3 cm and the left kidney measures 10.5
 cm.  There is no hydronephrosis identified on either kidney.  Multiple small
 simple cysts are seen in the right kidney, the largest of which measures 0.9 x
 0.8 x 1.0 cm.  A simple cyst is also seen at the upper pole of the left kidney
 measuring 1.3 x 1.9 x 2.4 cm.  No stones or solid masses are seen in either
 kidney.

 DOPPLER EXAMINATION:  Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images were
 obtained.  Note is made that this is an extremely limited Doppler examination
 due to the patient's condition and her ability to cooperate.  Arterial
 waveforms are identified within the hilum on each kidney.  Venous flow is also
 identified within the hilum of each kidney.  Due to the technically limited

1138,"IMPRESSION:  Decreased lung volumes with subsegmental atelectasis without
 evidence of focal consolidation to suggest possible pneumonia."
1139,"FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  To assess for worsening bilateral pleural effusions or pneumonia.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**9-12**], the patient has taken a
 slightly better inspiration.  There is persistent enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with worsening of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Continued or
 worsening right pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent
 with pleural effusion and volume loss involving the left lower lobe."
1140,"CONCLUSION:
 There has been interval resolution of the hemoperitoneum.  In the region of
 the previous surgery in relation to the small bowel, there is a focal area of
 small bowel wall thickening.  This is in relation to the mid-to- distal ileum.
 No proximal obstruction.  There is evidence of creeping fat. No collections.
 Small subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes also identified.
 Overall findings would be in keeping with crohn's disease affecting the mid-
 distal ileum."
1141,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Elderly woman with altered mental status and atrial pacer wire
 abscess.  Status post fall with patellar fracture shown on previous x-ray.
 Follow-up examination.

 FINDINGS:

 AP view of the right knee with the patient in supine position demonstrates
 normal alignment without evidence of fracture or dislocation.  Joint distances
 are preserved in both medial and lateral compartments.  Very small osteophytic
 reactions are noted at the medial edge of the tibial plateau, but no other
 significant degenerative abnormalities are identified.

 The lateral view confirms the preserved integrity of the knee joint and
 displays the patella in normal position.  No evidence of joint effusion.
 Rather extensive arterial wall calcifications are seen in the distal
 superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery and secondary divisions.

 AP view of the left knee also demonstrates normal alignment of the skeltal
 structures within the knee joint with preserved knee joint distances in both
 medial and lateral compartments.  No significant degenerative manifestations
 are identified.  Lateral view confirms preserved integrity of distal femur and
 proximal tibia and fibula, but the patella demonstrates structural
 abnormalities characterized by a semi-translucent line with some locally
 increased sclerosis consistent with a transverse nondisplaced fracture,
 apparently now healed.  Again analysis of soft tissue structures does not
 disclose evidence for joint effusion.  Also on the left side the patient has
 extensive arterial wall calcifications.

 There exists no previous similar study in our records available for
 comparison."

 There is interval placement of a PICC line, with tip likely terminating in the
 left brachiocephalic vein.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax. Again noted
 are diffuse bilateral interstitial opacities, not significantly changed from
 the prior exam.  In the region of the right upper lung zone is a focal area of
 increased alveolar opacity, which appears to be more prominent when compared
 to the prior exam.  Also noted is increased alveolar opacity in the right

 FINDINGS:  There is cardiomegaly, with sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips
 from recent CABG.  There is new patchy opacity at the left lung base, which
 may represent resolving postoperative atelectasis with effusion, but pneumonia
 cannot be excluded. There is a small left pleural effusion. The osseous

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1-weighted images were obtained following the
 administration of gadolinium contrast.  Post-contrast MP-RAGE images of the
 brain were also performed.

 FINDINGS:  Three fiducial markers overlie the skin along the anterior scalp.
 Imaging of the brain is limited, but there is no evidence of mass effect,
 hydrocephalus, shift of the normally midline structures, or abnormal

 ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of a
 total of 50 mcg of fentanyl, while patient's hemodynamic parameters were
 continuously monitored. Local anesthesia was provided with 1% buffered
 lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:

 An informed written consent was obtained after explaining the procedure,
 benefits, alternatives and risks involved. The patient was brought to the
 angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The upper abdomen
 was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and
 timeout was performed as per [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.

 A scout image of the abdomen was obtained and stored. The stomach was
 insufflated with air through the indwelling nasogastric tube. Under
 fluoroscopy, the outline of the stomach and colon were noted. The liver edge
 was was identified by percussion. Then under fluoroscopic guidance, three
 T-fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the stomach to the
 anterior abdominal wall in a triangular fashion.
 A small skin incision was made between the T-fastener buttons and an 18-gauge
 needle was introduced into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance. The
 position of the needle was confirmed with small amount of contrast injection.
 The needle was removed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 539**] wire and soft tissue tract dilated. Then a
 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 5929**] G-tube was placed over the wire. Guidewire was removed
 and retaining loop of the catheter was formed in the stomach and locked after
 confirming the position of the catheter by contrast injection.  The catheter
 was flushed, capped and secured to the skin. Sterile dressings were applied.

 MRI OF THE BRAIN

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Followup venous infarcts, hemorrhage and venous sinus
 thrombosis.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:
 The residual left occipital hematoma shown on the [**2114-9-11**] CT is again
 visualized.  The T2 hyperintense blood breakdown products measure
 approximately 7 cm in anterior/posterior dimension.  The residual
 intraventricular hemorrhage is also visible layering in the right occipital
 [**Doctor Last Name 383**].  There are multiple areas of parenchymal hemosiderin, as seen on
 the MRI [**2114-8-1**] and there is right frontal encephalomalacia.  That MRI
 preceded the hematoma but there are multiple intervening CT's.  Compared to
 the CT of two days previously, there is no change in the mass effect on the
 left lateral ventricle, the left parietal and occipital sulci or in the shift
 of the septum pellucidum towards the right.

 TECHNIQUE:  A 3D time-of-flight study was derived from overlapping axial slabs
 through the inferior cranium.

 FINDINGS:
 The intradural portions of the right vertebral artery are poorly seen.  This
 study is somewhat limited by patient motion.  There is focalization of the
 left vertebral artery and a focal stenosis cannot be excluded, although there
 is good distal flow.  The basilar artery and the distal internal carotid
 arteries are widely patent.  The major branches of the cerebral arteries
 appear normal.

 TECHNIQUE:  A venous 2D time-of-flight study was derived from a coronal slab.

 FINDINGS:
 Comparison is made to the technically superior study of [**8-1**].  There is
 chronic partial occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus.  Flow is seen in the
 internal cerebral veins.  The straight sinus is enlarged, best seen on the
 source images.  There may be minimal recanalization of the left transverse
 sinus.  There are large right transverse and sigmoid sinuses.  Segments of
 the sigmoid sinus are much less well seen than previously, likely related to
 artifact based on the source images.  A small amount of flow is seen in the

 ANESTHESIA:  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  A consent was obtained from patient's daughter after
 explaining the procedure and complications.  Patient was brought to the
 angiography suite, intubated, and sedated.  Patient was placed supine on the
 angiography table and right side of neck as well as existing catheter prepped
 and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A preprocedure timeout was
 performed.  An initial scout radiograph demonstrated appropriate position of
 the existing line.  After appropriate measurements were made, a subcutaneous
 tunnel was created from right anterior chest wall to the skin entry site of
 the existing catheter.  A 14 French AngioDynamics catheter measuring 19 cm
 tip-to-cuff is pulled through the tunnel, exiting at site of the pre-existing
 catheter.  Both ports of the original catheter were aspirated and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 379**] wire
 was advanced through one of the ports into the IVC.  The existing line was
 then removed over the [**Doctor Last Name 379**] wire and a peel-away sheath advanced over the wire
 under fluoroscopic guidance.  The [**Doctor Last Name 379**] wire and inner dilator were then
 removed.  The double-lumen HD catheter was then advanced through the peel-away
 sheath and the sheath removed.  Post-procedural chest x-ray demonstrated
 appropriate positioning of the dialysis catheter with tip positioned in the
 right atrium.  Both ports aspirated and flushed easily.  The skin incision
 over the venopuncture site closed with 4-0 Vicryl and the catheter anchored to

 significantly changed.  There is interval decrease in the amount of
 subcutaneous emphysema and pneumoperitoneum.  The percutaneous G tube pigtail
 terminates in the proximal duodenum.  The bowel loops are normal in caliber,
 without evidence of obstruction.  The liver, pancreas, spleen and adrenals are
 normal in appearance.  The gallbladder demonstrates vicarious excretion of IV
 contrast and a single dependent stone, unchanged.  There is no evidence of
 undue distention or wall thickening to suggest acute cholecystitis.  There is
 no change in the multiple renal cysts, the largest on the right measuring 3 x
 2.6 cm and the largest on the left measures 3.8 x 3.8 cm.  There is no

 INDICATION:  77-year-old man with rib fractures, rule out effusion.

 CHEST, PORTABLE:  The chest cavity was evaluated.  There is a small effusion
 containing internal echoes. It is too small to mark for bedside thoracentesis."
1200,"CLINICAL INFORMATION:  The patient is an 80-year-old woman with cardiogenic
 shock from acute MR, with pacemaker in place.  A request was made to place a
 temporary hemodialysis catheter with VIP port.

 OPERATORS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3013**] [**Name (STitle) 3014**] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 360**] [**Name (STitle) 65**], the attending radiologist,
 who was present and supervised during whole procedure.

 PROCEDURE:  Placement of temporary hemodialysis catheter.

 ANESTHESIA:  Lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  After risks and benefits of the procedure as well as
 local anesthesia were explained, informed consent was obtained.  The patient
 was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.
 The left side of the neck was prepared and draped in the usual sterile
 fashion.  The left internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture
 needle under fluoroscopic guidance.  Hard copies of the ultrasound were
 stored.  A 0.018 wire was then placed through the needle into the SVC using
 flouroscopic guidance. A small incision was made over the needle and the
 needle was removed and replaced with a 4.5 French micropuncture sheath.  The
 wire and the inner 3 French sheath were removed and replaced with a 0.035
 [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire with the tip of the [**Doctor Last Name 66**] wire terminated in the IVC.  The 4.5
 French sheath was then removed over the wire and a 12 French dilator was
 placed over the wire to dilate the soft tissue tract into the left IJ.  The
 dilator was then removed. A 12 French triple lumen 20-cm temporary
 hemodialysis catheter with a VIP port was then placed over the wire into the
 left IJ with the tip eventually terminated in the right atrium.  All three
 ports of the catheter were aspirated and flushed easily.  The ports were
 capped.  The catheter was sutured to the skin and a sterile dressing was
 applied.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no immediate
 complications."

 heart.  The pulmonary vessels show some upper zone redistribution consistent
 with left heart failure.  There is evidence of ill-defined
 atelectasis/infiltrate in the left lower lobe behind the heart.  There is also
 some widening of the superior mediastinum consistent with tortuosity of the
 brachiocephalic arteries.  The aorta is slightly unfolded.  Prominence of the

1205,"FINAL REPORT
 CT OF THE HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2197-4-24**].

 HISTORY:  80-year-old man, status post fall, taking Coumadin; evaluate for
 bleed.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous 5 mm axial tomographic sections were obtained from the
 skull base to the vertex and viewed in brain, bone, and lung window on the
 workstation.

 FINDINGS:  There are no comparison studies on record.  There is a severe acute
 soft tissue injury with large right frontal and left parietovertex soft tissue
 swelling, subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous
 emphysema.  This is associated with an extensive, circumferential oblique-
 coronal skull fracture which traverses the right frontal and left temporal
 bones, as well as the sphenoid bone and clivus, described in more detail
 below.  The right frontal fracture is associated with a focal lentiform extra-
 axial hematoma measuring roughly 8 mm in thickness and 3.5 cm in maximal
 transverse dimension.  This demonstrates a relatively low-attenuation portion,
 anteriorly, which may represent acute, non-clotted blood.  This collection may
 be bounded by the coronal suture, and therefore lie in the epidural space.
 There is moderate subarachnoid hemorrhage occupying the immediately subjacent
 sulci, which are slightly flattened, due to the mass effect of the hematoma.
 No definite adjacent parenchymal contusion is seen, and there is no associated
 shift of the midline structures or mass effect upon the ipsilateral lateral
 ventricle. There is no evidence of subfalcine, uncal or downward
 transtentorial herniation.  No significant extra-axial hematoma is identified
 at the corresponding left frontotemporal fracture site, though there is
 subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci in this region, and there may be a small
 parenchymal contusion, at the level of the left sylvian fissure.

 There is extensive left supra- and periorbital soft tissue edema and
 hemorrhage, which does not appear to violate the orbital cone, and the
 retrobulbar fat in both orbits, as well as the periorbita, is preserved,
 though there is a small amount of right intraorbital emphysema, subjacent to
 an oblique fracture through that orbital roof.  There is extensive acute
 hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a
 blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum.  Review of bone window
 images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with
 one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing
 the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the
 ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the
 basisphenoid portion of the clivus.  Note that though there is opacification
 of the right mastoid air cells and small fluid level within the ipsilateral
 middle ear cavity, no definite right temporal bone fracture is identified (on
 these 2.5 mm sections).

 The dominant fracture component traversing the left frontal extending into the
 temporal bone continues as a longitudinal fracture involving the mastoid
 portion of the left temporal bone which, again, is largely fluid-filled with
 fluid in the aditus ad antrum.  The relatively thick sections suggest some
 degree of dissociation as well as lateral displacement of the ossicular chain,
 related to the longitudinal fracture.  Additionally, there is a suggestion of
 an oblique-transverse component, extending medially, which transverses the
 bony vestibule, with the appearance of pneumolabyrinth. Though there is
 extensive pneumocephalus as well as apparent dural venous gas bubbles, likely
 related to the series of fractures, described above, there is no definite
 fracture line traversing the occipital condyles, jugular foramina or
 hypoglossal or carotid canals, on these sections.

 Also noted is extensive ""smash"" fracture involving the nose with extensively
 comminuted, overriding fractures of both nasal bones, likely involving the
 bony nasal septum and, probably, the maxillary spine of the nose.

 COMMENT:  Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 18477**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2455**] (Trauma SICU) at the
 immediate conclusion of the examination, and recommendation for dedicated
 temporal bone CT was made."

1216,"FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure with worsening consolidations, to assess for
 change.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**7-2**], there is little overall change
 in the bilateral pulmonary opacifications.  Extensive retrocardiac
 opacification persists.  This is consistent with volume loss in the left lower

 Pulmonary edema has progressed since [**4-24**] at 8:23 p.m. obscuring more
 focal areas of pulmonary contusion.  Cardiac silhouette is normal size and
 unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions have increased slightly, more
 likely due to cardiac decompensation and continued bleeding into the pleural
 space.  Similarly, widening of the mediastinum from the aortopulmonic window
 to the thoracic inlet and thickening of the apical pleural margins has
 remained stable, comparable to the appearance on the torso CT, [**4-24**] at
 5:37 p.m.  There are no findings to suggest a physiologically significant
 pneumothorax, though small amount of pleural air could be present and not
 clearly identified on the supine radiograph, particularly along the upper left

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 upright position.  Comparison is made with the next previous similar study of
 [**2184-8-16**].  The previously identified moderate amount of right-sided
 pleural effusion has decreased markedly following the successfully performed
 thoracocentesis.  Only a mild degree of fluid blunting of the right lateral
 pleural sinus remains.  No new parenchymal infiltrates are seen and no
 pulmonary vascular congestion is identified.  Right apical area is examined
 with magnification device and there is no evidence of any apical pneumothorax
 or chest wall emphysema.  Previously described marked S-shaped scoliosis as
 before."
1230,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post motor vehicle accident. Altered mental status.

 COMPARISONS:  None.

 AP AND LATERAL VIEWS, LUMBAR SPINE: Trauma board limits fine osseous
 evaluation.  The vertebral bodies are normal in height and alignment.  No
 acute fracture is seen.  Contrast is seen within the renal collecting system
 bilaterally.  Visualized portions of the pelvis are unremarkable.

 evaluation. Diffuse degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine. The
 vertebral bodies are normal in height and alignment."
1231,"IMPRESSION:

 1.  Significant improvement with resolution of previously noted axillary,
 mesenteric, retroperitoneal and pelvic lymphadenopathy.  Currently, there is
 no evidence for enlarged lymph nodes; however, many normal-sized lymph nodes
 are identified.

 2.  Improvement in splenomegaly from previously 26 to currently 19 cm.

 3.  Multiple new nodular densities in the right upper lobe and single new
 nodule in the right lower lobe.  This is likely infectious in origin.

 AP PORTABLE CHEST, [**2141-11-29**] at 12:58 p.m.

 HISTORY:  Assess chest tube placement.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated earlier same day.

 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of the right-sided chest tube
 with the distal tip directed cephalad and projecting near the superior margin
 of the mediastinum at the T5-T6 level.  The previously noted large right
 pneumothorax has been largely evacuated although residual remain with
 approximately 13 mm of maximal visceral and parietal pleural separation noted
 at the lung apex.  Similarly, a large left pneumothorax has also decreased in
 size though no chest tube is evident on that side.  The maximal visceral and
 parietal pleural separation on that side is approximately 7 mm.  Improved
 aeration results in decreased opacity at the lung hila.  Indwelling right
 internal jugular central line, endotracheal tube, and nasogastric tube are
 again evident and stable in course and position.  There is atherosclerotic
 disease of the aorta with evidence of prior CABG.  Cardiac silhouette size is
 within normal limits.  Retrocardiac opacity persists and pneumonia cannot be
 entirely excluded."

 PORTABLE AP ERECT VIEW OF THE CHEST: Comparison [**2118-7-4**]. A right sided
 PICC line is present with its tip extending to the junction of the
 brachiocephalic and superior vena cava in the central chest. The distal 10 cm
 of the catheter takes an unusually straight course. Patient is s/p CABG and
 surgical clips and wires are again noted in the mediastinum. The aorta is
 heavily calcified. There is a patchy opacity in the right mid lung zone
 consistent with persistent pneumonia. There are bilateral perihilar opacities,
 increased from the prior study and consistent with pulmonary edema.

 There is no pneumothorax. There is stable right tracheal deviation."

 STUDY DONE:  Baby gram.

 DATE OF EXAM:  [**2108-6-1**].

 TIME OF EXAM:  23:36.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  This is a newborn, preterm infant with respiratory
 distress.

 FINDINGS:  A single, portable view of the chest and upper abdomen was
 obtained.  I have no prior films available for comparison.

 The heart size and pulmonary vascularity are within range of normal limits.
 There is a faint, bilateral ground-glass opacification of the lungs without
 the presence of a pleural effusion.  Differential possibilities include
 hyaline membrane disease and TTN."

 STUDY:  Right foot, two views.  [**2123-8-11**].

 HISTORY:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with lateral foot ulcer.  Evaluate for
 osteomyelitis.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to prior study from [**2123-7-15**].

 No localizing marker has been provided.  There is some soft tissue
 irregularity adjacent to the calcaneus, however, it is unclear whether or not
 this is the site of the patient's ulcer.  There is no definitive evidence for
 bony erosions or air within the soft tissues to suggest osteomyelitis.  There
 is again seen a small area of cortical irregularity along the distal aspect of
 the medial cuneiform which is unchanged from prior.  Vascular calcifications
 are identified.  There is some osteopenia of the bony structures."
1236,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  83 y/o male s/p G-tube placement, ? gastric/duodenal perforation.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the
 femoral heads without additional contrast. Contrast was given on the prior CT
 done at 11 P.M. on [**2109-1-15**].

 CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST:  There are bilateral pleural effusions with
 associated dependent atelectasis.  Subcutaneous gas is redemonstrated
 throughout the abdomen.  There is a large amount of gas within the peritoneum
 which is not significantly changed from the prior study.  There is a G-tube in
 place without evidence of gas attenuation surrounding the subcutaneous
 portion.  There is a small linear opacity to the right of the G-tube which may
 represent a free T fastener within the anterior gas-filled abdomen.  This is
 not significantly changed in position from the prior study.  The NGT has been
 removed in the interim.  A small hiatal hernia is present.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  A punctate area of high attenuation within the left lower lobe is
 redemonstrated and likely represents a granuloma.

 The liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenals are normal.  Several focal areas of
 low attenuation within both kidneys likely represent simple cysts.

 CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST:  Redemonstrated is subcutaneous gas which tracks along
 the anterior abdominal wall into the inguinal canals and scrotum.  There is
 also tracking of subcutaneous gas into the left thigh compartments.
 Diverticula are demonstrated throughout the sigmoid colon without evidence for
 diverticulitis.  The prostate is enlarged.

 The osseous structures are unremarkable."

 HISTORY: Hypocellular MDS lightheaded and falls, now with major fall with
 hematoma in right arm. Please x-ray both arms radius ulna and humerus.

 Right humerus two views.

 No localizing history available. There is soft tissue prominence about the
 arm. This contributes to underpenetration and limited bony detail on one view.
 However, on the other view of the humerus, no fracture is identified. No
 dedicated views of the elbow are obtained, but the available views of the
 elbow are within normal limits. In particular, the radial head is within
 normal limits on the views provided.

 Right forearm, two views.

 There is soft tissue edema. No fracture is detected involving the right
 forearm. Limited assessment of the wrist shows no finding suspicious for
 fracture.

 Left humerus, two views.

 There is surrounding soft tissue prominence. No fracture is detected. The left
 elbow is not fully assessed but is unremarkable on these views.

 Left forearm two views.

 No fracture is detected involving the left forearm. Limited assessment of the
 wrist shows no findings suspicious for fracture."
1243,"IMPRESSION: Nonspecific bowel gas pattern; given histories of multiple
 obstructions a low grade or early obstruction cannot be excluded."
1244,"IMPRESSION:

 1.  Interval mild decrease in size of large left pelvic soft tissue mass,
 which encases small bowel and the cecal tip.

 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST: The left costophrenic angle is not included
 as on the previous study.  There has been interval removal of endotracheal
 tube and NG tube. Right internal jugular catheter with its tip at the distal
 superior vena cava is in stable position. A left-sided pacemaker with the
 leads projecting over the right atrium and proximal right ventricle close to
 the tricuspid valve is stable. Cholecystectomy clips are noted in the right
 upper quadrant.  Hyperinflation and flattening of the diaphragms consistent
 with severe emphysema are again noted.  Right apical opacities with volume
 loss and superior displacement of the right hilum is grossly stable. New Left
 lower lung peribronchial pulmonary opacities and right sided opacity
 projecting over the right hilum are most compatible with assymetric pulmonary
 edema, while could alternatively represent pneumonia.  Right pleural effusion
 has increased in size.  Mediastinal structures are unchanged."

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, PA and lateral.

 INDICATION:  87-year-old female patient, preoperative for aortic valve
 replacement scheduled for [**2189-7-3**].

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  There is marked cardiac enlargement.  It involves mostly a left
 ventricular prominence to the left and posteriorly but also a moderate degree
 of left atrial enlargement can be identified with double contour on the
 frontal view and bulge posteriorly on the lateral projection.  The thoracic
 aorta is moderately widened and elongated and calcium deposits are seen in the
 wall, mostly at the level of the arch.  There are probably also some linear
 calcifications in the aortic valve area, but somewhat obscured by overlying
 vascular structures.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested and the
 lateral and posterior pleural sinuses are free.  Somewhat irregular peripheral
 pulmonary vascular pattern and slightly low positioned diaphragms are
 suggestive of some degree of COPD, but acute parenchymal infiltrates are not
 identified.  Skeletal structures demonstrate a general moderate degree of
 demineralization but there is no evidence of any vertebral body compression.

 myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure after intra-aortic balloon
 pump removal and re-positioning of the pulmonary artery catheter.

 Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to prior study obtained on [**2154-3-18**] at 216.

 The intra-aortic balloon pump has been removed.  There is no significant
 change in the position of the pulmonary artery catheter which appears to be at
 the superior portion of the main pulmonary artery.  The patient is in mild
 pulmonary edema which appears to be slightly more pronounced than on the prior
 study.  Calcifications of the mitral annulus are present.  There is no
 significant change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Bilateral pleural
 effusion left most likely more than right is unchanged.  No pneumothorax."

 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of a right chest wall ICD device with tip in the
 right ventricle. Cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are otherwise
 unchanged when compared to the previous study. There is again noted upper zone
 redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature and perihilar haziness consistent
 with CHF which is improved in the interval. Again noted are bilateral pleural

 INDICATION:  Fever, leukocytosis, evaluation for acute process.

 COMPARISON:  [**2134-4-15**].

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is slightly improved
 ventilation, as reflected by increased lung volumes.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged opacity in the retrocardiac lung areas with
 moderate air bronchograms.  The opacity extends towards the left costophrenic
 sinus.  In the appropriate setting, pneumonia should be suspected.

 In addition, there is minimal enlargement of the pulmonary vessels indicative
 of mild overhydration.

 HISTORY:  Anaplastic thyroid cancer.  Restaging.

 TECHNIQUE:  Continuous axial images through the neck were performed without
 intravenous contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were performed.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the neck performed [**2121-9-3**].

 FINDINGS:
 Evaluation of the neck is significantly limited without intravenous contrast.

 The right neck mass posterior to the right sternocleidomastoid muscle is
 ill-defined and not well evaluated given the lack of intravenous contrast.
 The visualized portion of the mass does appear significantly larger compared
 with the study performed [**2121-9-3**].  For comparison purposes, the axial
 dimensions of the mass is measured on image 62 of series 2 on the prior exam
 and compared with image 52 series 3 of the current study.  These axial
 dimensions measure 2.2 cm x 2.2 cm on the previous exam and 3.4 cm x 3.8 cm on
 the current exam.  The gross craniocaudal dimension of the mass has also
 increased, current study (image 40 series 5) measures 5.6 cm, compared with
 the previous study (image 47 series 300B) measuring 3.6 cm.  The surrounding
 neck structures grossly demonstrate increased mass effect as well.  The
 margins of lesion are ill-defined and therefore extent of the lesion cannot be
 determined.  The cervical vessels are not identified (lack of contrast) and
 therefore status is indeterminate.  No fat plane can be identified between the
 soft tissue mass and the esophagus.  Medialization of the right vocal cord is
 again noted as well as enlargement of the right ventricle consistent with
 right vocal cord paralysis. Extension of the mass into this region cannot be
 excluded.

 The tracheal stent is patent.  The lower esophagus is patulous and the
 previously described tracheal diverticulum is not seen on this examination.

 Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical spine with partial fusion of
 C5 and C6 vertebral bodies.  The well-circumscribed lytic lesions within the
 C3 and C4 vertebral bodies have not changed in appearance.  No new osseous
 lesions are identified.  There is mucosal thickening of multiple left ethmoid
 air cells and minimal thickening of the inferior aspect of the left maxillary
 sinus.  Minimal emphysematous changes are noted within the lung apices."

 FINDINGS:

 The patient has been extubated.  Right hemodialysis catheter and left central
 venous line are unchanged.  Allowing for slightly lower lung volumes the
 diffuse interstitial and alveolar pattern, which is predominantly central has
 slightly worsened for example in the perihilar regions bilaterally.  This
 could be due to superimposed pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal

 positioned in the stomach.  Right central venous catheter projects over mid to
 low SVC.  No pneumothorax.

 Increased opacity in retrocardiac region likely represents atelectasis and is
 new from a study obtained 10 hrs prior.  Left mid lung zone opacity is
 demonstrated.  Left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. There is no right
 pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vasculature is unremarkable."

 The patient is status post interval median sternotomy. A swan ganz catheter is
 in place with its tip in the right ventricle.  A small radiopacity at the
 level of the inferior aspect of the aortic arch is presumably the intra aortic
 balloon pump marker, which is therefore in satisfactory position.

 The right hemithorax is clear.  There is increased density at the left base
 with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm and lower costophrenic angle,
 findings which may reflect effusion with associated atelectasis. Pneumonia
 cannot be excluded.

 There is a small amount of subcutaneous emphysema at the base of the left
 neck. There is no evidence of pneumothorax."

 noted.  With the aerated lung, no consolidation or edema is noted.  There is
 minimal ill-defined opacity at the margins with the effusions likely
 reflecting adjacent volume loss.  There is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta.
 Senescent calcification of the tracheobronchial tree is again incidentally
 noted.  Cardiac silhouette size is difficult to assess given the large

 HISTORY:  66-year-old woman with lymphoma and fever.  Possible pneumonia.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without
 the need for intravenous contrast [**Doctor Last Name 1309**] reconstructed as contiguous 5- and
 1.25-mm thick axial and 5-mm thick coronal and parasagittal images compared to
 chest CT scanning since [**2170-5-17**], most recently [**2170-6-28**]:

 FINDINGS:  Bronchocentric ground-glass and bronchiolar nodulation almost
 entirely restricted to the right upper lobe has improved substantially since
 [**2170-6-28**] when the process was both more widespread in all lobes, and more
 severe in the right upper lobe.  A solid 6-mm wide right middle lobe nodule,
 3:34, is new.  Because there was no precursor lesion to this on [**6-28**] and
 because it is far more solid than any of the residual bronchocentric
 infection, this nodule is either infection due to another pathogen, such as
 Nocardia, or lymphoma.

 There is no pathologic enlargement of central lymph nodes which range up to 5
 mm in the right upper paratracheal station, 2:13, previously 7.6 mm and 7 mm
 in the left lower paratracheal station, 2:22, previously 8.9 mm.
 Atherosclerotic calcification is punctate, scattered in the left anterior
 descending coronary artery.  Small pericardial effusion has decreased since

 INDICATION:  Aortic intramural hematoma, evaluate for growth of intramural
 hematoma.

 COMPARISON:  [**2185-1-4**].  CTA of [**2184-12-30**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung apices to the upper
 abdomen prior to the administration of intravenous contrast.  Axial MDCT
 images were then obtained from the lung apices through the aortic bifurcation
 after the administration of 80 cc of intravenous Optiray in the arterial
 phase.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images, and oblique reformats, are
 provided.

 CONTRAST:  Intravenous nonionic contrast was administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this examination.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  An anterior
 mediastinal hematoma measures 5.2 x 7.6 cm, slightly increased since the most
 recent non-contrast chest CT of [**2185-1-4**], at which time it measured
 5.1 x 7.3 cm, and also increased from the initial examination of [**2184-12-30**], at which time it measured 4.2 x 7.4 cm.  Hemopericardium is unchanged.
 An ascending aortic aneurysm measures up to 5.0 cm, unchanged over multiple
 examinations.  Aortic mural thickening involving the arch and proximal
 descending aorta is unchanged.  There are numerous calcifications consistent
 with atheromatous disease.  Post-contrast images show extensive irregularity
 in the aortic arch consistent with atherosclerotic ulcers, but there is no
 evidence of active extravasation of contrast into the mediastinal hematoma.
 The great vessels are patent.  Separate origin of the left vertebral artery
 directly from the arch is again noted.  The pulmonary arteries appear
 unchanged.  The central airways are patent.  The heart and coronary arteries
 appear unchanged, including extensive coronary artery calcification.

 Bilateral pleural effusions have decreased since [**1-4**], and the density
 of the left pleural effusion ranges between 5 and 12 Hounsfield units without
 evidence of new hemothorax on the left.  Bilateral emphysematous changes are
 again noted.  The degree of atelectasis in the lower lobes is improved along
 with the decrease in pleural effusions.  No definite pulmonary nodules or
 masses are identified.  Pleural thickening along the right lateral chest wall
 is unchanged from multiple studies.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen,
 and adrenal glands appear unremarkable.  The gallbladder is non-distended.
 Borderline pancreatic ductal dilation (3.5 mm) is unchanged.  No masses are
 identified in the pancreas.  Bilateral renal cysts up to 9.2 cm in diameter
 are unchanged.  Marked atheromatous calcification of the abdominal aorta is
 consistent with atherosclerotic disease.  Three areas of focal dilation of the
 infrarenal aorta proximal to the aortic bifurcation, measure up to 3.1 cm and
 are unchanged from the earliest study.  Again noted is high-grade narrowing at
 the origins of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.  Single renal
 arteries bilaterally are patent although there is narrowing at the ostium of
 the left renal artery.

 Bone windows show degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine, bilateral
 L5 pars defects and grade 1 anterolisthesis of L5 on S1.  A compression
 deformity of the L2 vertebra is unchanged"
1342,"FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left lower lobe mucus plug removed at bronchoscopy.

 persist.  No change in the appearance of the monitoring and support devices."
1343,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest tube placement, evaluate for right pulmonary reexpansion.

 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated [**2184-9-22**].

 FINDINGS:  The patient has had a right mastectomy and a new right pleural
 drain is in situ.  A right apical pneumothorax is smalll.  The right pleural
 effusion has decreased in size, it is now small in volume.  New left lower
 lobe opacity may represent acute aspiration.  Blunting of the left lateral
 costodiaphragmatic angle is consistenty with a new small left pleural
 effusion.  The cardiac size is normal."
1344,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pseudoaneurysm.

 FINDINGS:

 The examination is limited, as the technologist was not permitted to remove
 the dressing over the right groin.  Limited scanning around the dressing shows
 no obvious hematoma or large pseudoaneurysm."

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate any evidence of anoxic brain injury.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT with contiguous axial images through the head were obtained
 without IV contrast.

 Comparison with prior CTs of [**2129-12-18**].

 FINDINGS:

 There is no evidence of acute hemorrhage.  There is no edema, mass, mass
 effect, or shift of midline structures.  The [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white matter differention is
 overall well-preserved, with no evidence of acute vascular territorial
 infarction. There is hypoattenuation in the right frontal region, with ex
 vacuo dilatation of frontal [**Doctor Last Name 503**] of right lateral ventricle, consistent with
 encephalomalacia related to remote infarction. There are multiple other
 hypoattenuating regions, some of them represent lacunes, as in the left
 thalamic region (2:14), where others most likely represent old post-embolic
 events, as noted in the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere (2:5). Otherwise,
 there is only mild hypoattenuation of the perivetricular white matter,
 consistent with chronic small vessel infarction. The ventricles and sulci are
 mildly prominent, representing global atrophy, age-related.

 Partially visualized paranasal sinuses are clear."

 venous line, unchanged.  There is marked worsening of the diffuse interstitial
 and alveolar infiltrate.  There is a small left pleural effusion and volume
 loss in both lower lungs."
1361,"IMPRESSION:  Worsening of a diffuse right opacity which likely represents a
 posteriorly layering pleural effusion.  A left retrocardiac opacity most
 likely represents atelectasis but a superimposed infiltrate cannot be
 excluded.  There is increased vascular engorgement.  These findings are
 concerning for worsening CHF."

 discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 5260**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27351**] RN from IV therapy shortly after the study on
 the same day."
1364,"IMPRESSION:

 1) No evidence of pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection.

 2) Emphysema and left lower lobe air space disease which may represent
 aspiration versus pneumonia versus atelectasis.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.

 3) New intra- and extra-hepatic biliary dilatation with a probable filling
 defect noted within the common bile duct, which could represent stones,
 sludge, or neoplastic process. An MRCP is recommended for further evaluation.

 4) 2.8-cm left adnexal cyst which appears larger compared to the prior study.
 A pelvic ultrasound is recommended for further characterization given the
 patient's post-menopausal status.

 1THYROID BIOPSY

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient who underwent a CT examination of the neck
 during an episode of an infected tooth.  At that time, an incidental thyroid
 nodule was noted on the right side and ultrasound performed.  This
 demonstrated bilateral nodules, with the dominant nodule on the right side.
 The patient presents for fine needle aspiration.

 FINDINGS:  As previously noted, most significant finding is one of the
 dominant nodules in the right thyroid lobe measuring 33.3 x 26.9 x 31.0 mm.
 This has a well defined halo, is isoechoic with some spongy components.  Color
 Doppler reveals only peripheral vascularity.

 TECHNIQUE:  Following standard preparation and local anesthesia, under direct

 INDICATION:  81-year-old male with mediastinal wound dehiscence and elevated
 white blood cell count, of unknown etiology.  Please evaluate for abscess,
 mediastinitis or abdominal process.

 COMPARISON:  [**2141-12-5**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the thoracic inlet
 to the symphysis with oral and IV contrast.  Multiplanar reformatted images
 were obtained.

 IV CONTRAST:  130 cc Optiray 350.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There is a small hypoattenuating nodule within the
 right lobe of the thyroid, which is unchanged in appearance. A tracheostomy
 tube is again noted, unchanged in position.  There is vague stranding within
 the mediastinal fat surrounding the tracheostomy tube, however, no focal fluid
 collection is detected.  There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque within
 the aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta including the left subclavian
 artery.

 The major airways are patent down to the subsegmental level bilaterally. There
 is again noted to be a large left pleural effusion and stable complete left
 lower lobe collapse.  There may be a loculated component of the left effusion
 and a complex effusion cannot be entirely excluded. A previously noted small
 right pleural effusion has increased to a moderate- size.  There is an
 increased amount of passive atelectasis from the larger right pleural effusion
 in the right lower lobe. In the visualized lung parenchyma, no acute
 infectious process is suspected.

 There is dense three- vessel coronary artery calcification and no appreciable
 pericardial effusion is detected.  A mitral valve replacement is again noted,
 unchanged in position.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, and pancreas are all
 unremarkable.  New small calcification in the gallbladder suggests interval
 development of small stones. There is stable focal thickening of the left
 adrenal gland. In the upper pole of the right kidney, there is an exophytic
 hypoattenuating lesion which is stable in appearance, most consistent with a
 simple cyst.  The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. There is no
 hydronephrosis.

 A gastrostomy tube is again noted well seated within the stomach without
 evidence of abnormality.  No free fluid or free air is identified within the
 abdomen. There is dense calcific atherosclerotic plaque throughout the
 abdominal aorta and iliac branches.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is stable herniation of colon through the
 right inguinal canal and new herniation of colon at the ostium of the left
 inguinal canal.  The colon is filled with stool without evidence of
 obstruction.  The bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter.  No free fluid
 or free air is detected within the pelvis.

 OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:  There is mild increased overlap of the osseous fragments
 of the sternotomy (2:28) suggesting possible movement at the sternotomy site.
 No focal fluid collections are detected within the tissues surrounding the
 sternotomy site.  There is multilevel degenerative changes within the lumbar
 spine with anterior vertebral body osteophyte formation and decreased
 intervertebral bodies disc space at the L5-S1 level."

 junction."
1372,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mediastinal hematoma evaluation.

 COMPARISON: CT from [**2184-12-31**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Unenchanced MDCT of the chest was performed with coronal and
 sagittal reformats using the high-res CT protocol.

 CT CHEST WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The mediastinal hematoma is slightly
 larger in size measuring 7.3 x 5.1 cm, (2, 29) compared to 7.0 x 4.1 cm in
 greatest transaxial dimension previously.  The adjacent fat stranding in the
 mediastinum is unchanged. The small hemopericardium is unchanged. There is
 persistent extensive thickening of the aorta.  There are calcifications in the
 aortic wall.  The caliber of the ascending and descending aorta is unchanged,
 including known aneutrismatic dilatationo of ascending aorta.

 There has been increase in size in the left pleural effusion with some
 atelectasis proximal to it. There is a small effusion on the right, with a
 disproportionate amount of atelectasis compared to the size of the effusion,
 thus suggesting consolidation. However, there is no evidence of any more
 central obstructing lesion.

 There is emphysema throughout both lungs. There is a soft tissue density in
 the right uper costal pleura  (2, 37), unchanged since previous study.

 Imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates  persistent calcification of
 the aorta. There are large bilateral renal cysts, which are unchanged.

 HISTORY:  Assess endotracheal tube.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from [**2115-8-29**].

 FINDINGS:  The tip of the endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm from the carina.
 Nasogastric tube courses through the esophagus into the stomach and off the
 field of view of the radiograph.  A VP shunt catheter courses along the right
 hemithorax and off the field of view of the radiograph.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged which may be reflective of cardiomegaly.  There is
 slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature which may be representative of
 pulmonary congestion in comparison to the prior examination.  Lung volumes are
 low and there is bibasilar atelectasis.  No areas of consolidation are seen.
 Surgical clips projecting over the patient's right upper quadrant are likely
 related to prior cholecystectomy.  Thickening of the right pleura and old
 mulitple right sided rib fractures."
1376,"FINAL REPORT

 ground-glass opacities have the same caliber as the ones going to the
 non-affected lung.  Subpleural interstitial abnormality in the left upper lobe
 has the appearance of post-radiation changes.

 A tiny calcified granuloma is in the right upper lobe (series 104A, 71).  A
 2-mm nodule in the right upper lobe (5, 25) is not calcified.  Tiny calcified
 granuloma is in the left lower lobe (5, 30).  There is no pleural or
 pericardial effusion.  Cardiac size is normal.  Moderate calcifications are in
 the left circumflex, LAD, main left coronary, and right main coronary artery.
 Mild calcification is in the aortic annulus.  There is no mediastinal, hilar
 or axillary lymphadenopathy.  The main pulmonary arteries are mildly enlarged.
 The right main pulmonary artery measures 30.5 mm.

 Healing fracture is in the lateral aspect of sixth left rib.  Irregularity in
 the distal aspect of the right scapula could represent an old healed fracture
 or a prominent nutrient foramen.  There are no bone findings of malignancy.

 In the upper abdomen there is mild splenomegaly, the liver has nodular
 contours and is mildly shrunken.  The aorta is moderately calcified.
 Calcification is seen in the ostium of the right renal artery."
1389,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Multiple medical problems including endocarditis and altered
 mental status.  Evaluate for septic infarction.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial non-contrast CT scans of the brain were obtained.

 Comparison is made to the previous study of [**2118-6-30**].

 As previously identified, there are mild periventricular white matter areas of
 hypodensity and basal ganglia and lacunar infarction, which are stable.  There
 is no evidence of cortical territorial infarction or of gyral edema or shift
 of structures to suggest acute infarction.  The sulci are widened, the
 ventricles are prominent, indicating volume loss.  No acute intracranial
 hemorrhage is evident.

 There are dense carotid calcifications.  The skull appears normal.  The
 visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoids are normally aerated."
1390,"IMPRESSION:

 1.  Increased size of left pelvic mass since [**2192-12-4**] which extensively
 involves a segment of small bowel and likely the rectum.

 2.  Little change in periaortic and pelvic lymphadenopathy since [**2192-12-4**].

 3.  No change in moderate left hydronephrosis since [**2192-12-4**]."
1391,IMPRESSION:  No evidence of DVT.
1392,"FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Followup pleural effusion.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of [**6-11**], there is probably some increase
 in the initial amount of right pleural effusion seen layering out along the
 right lateral chest wall on the prior study.  Mild opacification at the left
 base is consistent with a small effusion.  Bibasilar atelectasis is seen.
 Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged.  Coarse interstitial markings could
 reflect chronic lung disease, elevated pulmonary venous pressure, or both."
1393,"FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A 48-year-old male with acute myocardial infarction and
 fever.

 TECHNIQUE:   Portable AP chest.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 FINDINGS:  The heart is within upper limits of normal for size.  The
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  There is hilar prominence and
 upper zone redistribution, consistent with congestive heart failure.  The
 lungs appear clear, with no confluent areas of opacification to suggest
 pneumonia.  There are no pleural effusions.  Please note that the left
 costophrenic angle was omitted from this examination."
1394,"IMPRESSION:

 1.  No acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  MRI with diffusion-
 weighted imaging is more sensitive for detection of acute stroke.
 2. Soft tissue lesion in the posterior neck, unchanged, ? sebaceous cyst.
 Recommend clinical correlation.

 HISTORY:  Coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis, and extensive smoking
 history.  Abnormal thyroid function tests and suggestion of goiter on chest
 radiograph.

 COMPARISON:  No previous chest CT.  Chest radiograph of [**2124-5-24**] is available
 for correlation.

 TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast chest CT.

 FINDINGS:  The superior poles of the thyroid gland are incompletely imaged.
 The gland is diffusely enlarged, with retrotracheal extent of the right lobe.
 Multiple calcifications - containing thyroid nodules are present.  The trachea
 is narrowed to two thirds of its normal diameter at the level of the enlarged
 thyroid.  More distally, the tracheobronchial tree is patent to the
 subsegmental levels.  Extensive emphysema is present.  There are no suspicious
 pulmonary nodules or opacities.  Scattered subcentimeter prevascular,
 peritracheal, and subcarinal lymph nodes are not pathologically enlarged by CT
 criteria.

 Extensive atherosclerotic calcifications are present in the aorta and coronary
 arteries.  Calcifications are also noted in the aortic valve.  Heart size is
 within normal limits.  There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.

 There is a small hiatal hernia.  A sharply marginated 1 cm hypodensity is
 present in the liver adjacent to the gallbladder fossa, which most likely
 represents a cyst although evaluation is limited in the absence of intravenous
 contrast. The imaged portions of the spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and
 kidneys appear unremarkable on limited noncontrast evaluation. The imaged
 bones appear unremarkable."

 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is within normal limits with a slightly tortuous aorta.
 Degenerative changes are noted throughout the visualized spine."
1397,"FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON [**2121-11-10**]

 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph from [**2121-9-1**] as well as a CT
 chest from [**2121-11-7**].

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Tracheal stent in place, shortness of breath and cough,
 question aspiration. History of anaplastic thyroid cancer.

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  A tracheal stent
 is again noted along the upper to mid portion of the trachea.  The overall
 configuration appears stable.  The lungs are hyperinflated and there is no
 evidence of pneumonia or CHF.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 unremarkable.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Osseous
 structures are intact and stable with degenerative changes at the right AC
 joint noted.  There is a gastrostomy tube partially visualized in the left
 upper quadrant."
1398,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: Patient with CVA for further evaluation with MRA.

 TECHNIQUE: 3D time of flight MRA of the Circle of [**Location (un) **] was acquired.

 FINDINGS: There is narrowing of low signal at the distal portion of right
 middle cerebral artery indicative of stenosis. The intracranial carotid left
 middle cerebral and intracerebral arteries demonstrate normal flow signal.
 There appears to be a fetal left posterior cerebral artery.

 The basilar artery demonstrates diffuse narrowing of flow signal with a
 moderate stenosis in the mid basilar region. There is also a flow signal gap
 at the junction of the right distal vertebral and basal artery indicative of
 high grade stenosis. The distal right vertebral artery is not visualized which
 could be secondary to occlusion or high grade stenosis."

 3)  Dense left retrocardiac density, consistent with atelectasis or pneumonia."
1409,"FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Sudden increase in O2 requirements.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.

 CHEST:  Comparison is made with the prior film from [**1-5**].  Degree of failure
 has improved since the prior chest x-ray.  Upper zone redistribution and
 bilateral effusions are present.  A right upper mediastinal mass is present.
 This could be due to a distended azygos vein.  If it persists further
 evaluation is recommended."
1410,"IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with congestive heart failure with bilateral
 pleural effusions."
1411,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: Left pontine stroke and type II odontoid fracture.

 There is premature spillage of liquid into the valleculae and piriform
 sinuses. There is a slight delay of the oral phase with pudding thickened
 material. Solids were not tested due to the lack of dentation. There is no
 aspiration or penetration. No esophageal web, diverticula or other mucosal
 abnormality are detected."
1412,"IMPRESSION:  Tubes and lines in good position.  New patchy density in the
 right upper lobe and left lower lobe may be related to aspiration."
1413,"FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  83 year old male status post 14-French gastrostomy tube placement
 on [**2109-1-15**].  A CT scan performed later that evening demonstrated extensive
 subcutaneous and intraperitoneal air.  The T fasteners continued to anchor the
 anterior gastric wall to the anterior abdominal wall, but due to the presence
 of intraperitoneal air, are under a significant amount of tension.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2091**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27**] and [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 629**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 884**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27**] was
 present throughout the procedure.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  The patient was placed supine on the CT
 scanner, and selective upper abdominal images were obtained, demonstrating
 pneumoperitoneum.  The skin was then cleansed and draped, and under CT
 fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge needle was placed just to the left of
 midline.  A 0.035 guide wire was then placed through the needle, and the
 needle was exchanged for a 4-French SOS Omni catheter.  Several 60 cc syringes
 of air were then removed under a three-way stop-cock system.  Images obtained
 through the upper abdomen following removal demonstrated a significant
 reduction in the amount of free air.  The anterior wall of the stomach is
 nearly adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall, with the degree of tension
 placed on the T fasteners significantly decreased.  A small-to-moderate amount
 of free air remains.

 COMPLICATIONS:  None.

 COMPLICATIONS:  None."

 COMPARISON:  [**2121-9-30**] and CT torso [**2121-10-23**].

 SEMI-UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  There is linear opacity at the left lung
 base, likely plate-like atelectasis. There is no evidence of pneumonia or CHF.
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The heart size is normal.
 Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta and atherosclerotic calcification are
 unchanged from prior. The hilar contours and pulmonary vasculature are
 unremarkable. Right hemidiaphragm is elevated. Study is underpenetrated,
 limiting evaluation."
1416,"IMPRESSION:  Improved pulmonary edema.  However, more focal consolidations at
 the right lower and left upper lung are more evident, perhaps representing
 pneumonic consolidations."
