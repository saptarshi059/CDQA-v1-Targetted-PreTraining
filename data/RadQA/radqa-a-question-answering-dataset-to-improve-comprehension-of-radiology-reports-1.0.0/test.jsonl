Question stability of bleed.\n\n COMPARISON:  Head CT from [**Hospital 38208**] Hospital dated [**2104-1-1**].\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT.\n\n FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior days study, there is stable appearance of the\n right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.  At the\n superior margin of the parenchymal hemorrhage there is a rounded heterogeneous\n focus which could represent a metastatic lesion.  An additional 2mm hyperdense\n focus, possibly hemorrhage, is noted in the posteromedial margin of the left\n thalamus, with surroundng edema.  Low-attenuation foci seen in both basal\n ganglia and insular regions are consistent with chronic lacunar infarcts.\n There is no shift of midline structures.  The ventricles are stable in\n appearance.  The osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.", "question": "Did the hemorrhagic mass change in size?", "id": "853498_1_3_O", "answers": {"answer_start": [354], "text": ["stable appearance of the\n right parietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with surrounding edema.
