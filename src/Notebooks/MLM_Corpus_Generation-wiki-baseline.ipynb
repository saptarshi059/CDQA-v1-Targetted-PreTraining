The\\n principal right frontal fracture appears unchanged in its configuration as\\n does the extensively comminuted nasal bone fractures.  There is an extensive\\n fracture involving the sphenoid sinus septum, with rotation of the fracture\\n fragment present.  There is a probable additional fracture involving the\\n basisphenoid, principally to the right of midline.  The right orbital roof\\n fracture is well depicted on the coronal images as a \"blowout\" type.  At this\\n time, there is no definite sign of either right orbital emphysema or\\n pneumocephalus, aside from a tiny focus of gas near the superior portion of\\n the falx cerebri. Nevertheless, the fact that these more extensive gas\\n collections seen on the previous scan does raise the concern for communication\\n between the orbit and sinuses with the intracranial region. There is a\\n crescent-shaped of soft tissue density immediately subjacent to the right\\n orbital roof, consistent with an orbital hematocyst. The maximum thickness of\\n this abnormality is 6 mm. Transversely, it extends from approximately the\\n level of the superior oblique muscle to the area of the lacrimal gland.  There\\n is no proptosis. There is a mild degree of right and more moderate left-sided\\n periorbital soft tissue swelling noted, particularly on the medial side\\n adjoining the nose.  There is partial imaging of the petrous temporal bones,\\n and confirmation of the suspected complex fracture of this bone on the left\\n side, including the ossicular dislocation involving the incus. There is\\n bilateral presumed hemotympanum and considerable opacification of the mastoid\\n sinuses, along with marked degrees of opacification of both maxillary sinuses,\\n likely with hemorrhagic contents.  The sphenoid sinus is essentially totally\\n opacified and there are bilateral air-fluid levels and substantial\\n opacification of both ethmoid sinuses.  Moderate mucosal thickening and a\\n probable air-fluid level is noted within the frontal sinus.  While the present\\n study is not optimized for brain tissue detail, there is probably evidence for\\n right frontal subarachnoid blood, but no epidural hematoma.  Over the 24 hours\\n between scans, there is development of what appear to be bilateral subdural\\n hygromas, somewhat more prominent on the patient\\'s left side.', 'question': 'Do we see any mandibular fractures?', 'is_impossible': True, 'id': '959241_1_1_O', 'answers': {'answer_start': [], 'text': []}}\n",

The pericardial thickness was normal.  The diameters\\n of the ascending and descending thoracic aorta were normal.  The main\\n pulmonary artery diameter was normal.  The left atrial AP dimension was mildly\\n increased.\\n The left ventricular end-diastolic dimension was moderately increased.  The\\n end-diastolic volume was moderately increased.  The calculated left\\n ventricular ejection fraction was normal at 65% with normal regional systolic\\n function.  The anteroseptal and inferolateral wall thicknesses were normal.\\n The left ventricular mass was normal.\\n\\n Coronary Imaging\\n \\tCT coronary angiography revealed an anomalous origin of a dominant right\\n coronary artery from the pulmonary artery.  The right coronary artery was\\n increased in size but not aneurismal.  The origin and orientation of the left\\n main coronary artery was normal.   The left main was increased in size but not\\n aneurismal.  The left main trifurcated into the LAD, LCx and ramus intermedius\\n without evidence of disease.  The LAD was increased in size but not\\n aneurismal, with large septal branches and multiple bridging collaterals to\\n the right coronary artery.

There is a severe acute\\n soft tissue injury with large right frontal and left parietovertex soft tissue\\n swelling, subgaleal hematomas and extensive laceration with subcutaneous\\n emphysema.  This is associated with an extensive, circumferential oblique-\\n coronal skull fracture which traverses the right frontal and left temporal\\n bones, as well as the sphenoid bone and clivus, described in more detail\\n below.  The right frontal fracture is associated with a focal lentiform extra-\\n axial hematoma measuring roughly 8 mm in thickness and 3.5 cm in maximal\\n transverse dimension.

No significant extra-axial hematoma is identified\\n at the corresponding left frontotemporal fracture site, though there is\\n subarachnoid hemorrhage in the sulci in this region, and there may be a small\\n parenchymal contusion, at the level of the left sylvian fissure.\\n\\n There is extensive left supra- and periorbital soft tissue edema and\\n hemorrhage, which does not appear to violate the orbital cone, and the\\n retrobulbar fat in both orbits, as well as the periorbita, is preserved,\\n though there is a small amount of right intraorbital emphysema, subjacent to\\n an oblique fracture through that orbital roof.  There is extensive acute\\n hemorrhage within the nasal cavity and sphenoid sinus, bilaterally, with a\\n blood-fluid level within the left maxillary antrum.  Review of bone window\\n images demonstrates extensive comminution of the vertex skull fracture, with\\n one dominant component continuing in an oblique coronal plane and traversing\\n the lateral wall and medial aspect of the right orbit, exiting through the\\n ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, as well as the sphenoid sinus and the\\n basisphenoid portion of the clivus.

Drs.\\n [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 325**] and [**Doctor Last Name 27**] were present throughout procedure.\\n\\n CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:\\n 20 ml of Optiray 320 at 60%. 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 1 mg Versed were given\\n intravenously in divided doses under continued hemodynamic monitoring for\\n conscious sedation.\\n\\n PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:\\n The procedure was described and informed consent obtained. The stomach was\\n insufflated with air, and point of entry into the body of stomach was marked.\\n Following local anesthetic infiltration, a 19 gauge spinal needle was inserted\\n under fluoroscopic guidance until tenting of the stomach wall was noticed. The\\n lumen of the stomach was then entered, and a flush of air was noted through\\n the spinal needle. At this time, a 0.035 Bentson guidewire was placed through\\n the needle into the lumen of the stomach, and the needle was removed. The\\n tract was then dilated using 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 French dilators under\\n fluoroscopic guidance. A small amount of contrast material was injected during\\n the course of dilatation which again demonstrated gastric location. The tract\\n was continually dilated up to 18 French, and a 16 French MIC gastrostomy tube\\n was advanced over a stiff guidewire. At this time, contrast was injected\\n through the tube and demonstrated its tip to be still in the stomach. A\\n significant amount of previously injected contrast material was noted in a\\n large hiatal hernia projecting above the left hemidiaphragm. With the\\n guidewire projecting over the body and fundus of the stomach, the securing\\n balloon of the MIC gastrostomy tube was inflated with contrast material and\\n normal saline, and was noticed to project outside the body of the stomach. The\\n tube was deflated, the wire removed, and contrast material was then injected\\n directly through the gastrostomy tube, which demonstrated a peritoneal\\n location.\\n\\n The stomach was reinsufflated with air, and two T-fasteners were placed\\n through the wall of the stomach and secured to the anterior abdominal wall. A\\n 19 gauge needle was then used to access the stomach in an adjacent separate\\n puncture site over the anterior abdominal wall. An 0.035 wire was placed\\n through the needle, the needle removed, the tract dilated to 7 French. A 7\\n French sheath was then placed over the needle, and access into the gastric\\n antrum was obtained. A 5 French multipurpose catheter was advanced over the\\n guidewire, and the guidewire was exchanged for an angled glidewire. Following\\n several technical manipulations, the guidewire was passed through the first\\n portion of the duodenum and eventually beyond the ligament of Treitz. The\\n multipurpose catheter was advanced over the guidewire, and the glidewire was\\n exchanged for an Amplatz Superstiff guidewire. The multipurpose catheter and\\n 7-French sheath were removed, and a 14 French dilator/peelaway sheath was then\\n advanced over the Superstiff guidewire into the duodenum. The inner dilator\\n was removed, and a 14 French [**Doctor Last Name 2583**] gastrojejunstomy catheter was placed\\n through the peelaway sheath. With continued advancement of the catheter\\n through the proximal duodenum, the guidewire in the ligament of Treitz\\n retracted. This in part was due to the lack of flexibility in the\\n gastroduodenal region, secondary to the presence of a large hiatal hernia. At\\n this time, a T-fastener placed previously was noted to have dislodged during\\n advancement of the catheter and peelaway sheath. At this time, four new T-\\n fasteners were placed under fluoroscopic guidance under continued gas\\n insufflation via the NG tube. Access was again gained to the body of the\\n stomach, and a 14 French pigtail catheter was placed fluoroscopic guidance,\\n such that the pigtail formed in the antrum of the stomach. The catheter was\\n secured to the patient's skin using 0 Prolene suture material and Flexitrak\\n dressing.\\n\\n COMPLICATIONS:\\n Free air was noted under the hemidiaphragms during and following the\\n procedure.

A CT scan performed later that evening demonstrated extensive\\n subcutaneous and intraperitoneal air.  The T fasteners continued to anchor the\\n anterior gastric wall to the anterior abdominal wall, but due to the presence\\n of intraperitoneal air, are under a significant amount of tension.\\n\\n RADIOLOGISTS:  Drs.

The skin was then cleansed and draped, and under CT\\n fluoroscopic guidance, a 19-gauge needle was placed just to the left of\\n midline.  A 0.035 guide wire was then placed through the needle, and the\\n needle was exchanged for a 4-French SOS Omni catheter.  Several 60 cc syringes\\n of air were then removed under a three-way stop-cock system.  Images obtained\\n through the upper abdomen following removal demonstrated a significant\\n reduction in the amount of free air.  The anterior wall of the stomach is\\n nearly adjacent to the anterior abdominal wall, with the degree of tension\\n placed on the T fasteners significantly decreased.  A small-to-moderate amount\\n of free air remains.\\n\\n COMPLICATIONS:  None.\\n\\n COMPLICATIONS:  None.', 'question': 'Was the percutaneous drainage successful?', 'is_impossible': False, 'id': '748289_1_2_O', 'answers': {'answer_start': [1234], 'text': ['significant\\n reduction in the amount of free air']}}\n"
