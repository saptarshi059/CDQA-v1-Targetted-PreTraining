There is no separation of\\n bowel loops, no abnormal mucosal thickening or enhancement.  No persistent\\n strictures.  No mesenteric adenopathy.  Evaluation of the large bowel is\\n somewhat limited by the residual fecal material; however, no gross\\n abnormalities are seen except to note sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence\\n of diverticulitis.  No free fluid.\\n\\n The visualized portions of the liver, spleen, gallbladder, and kidneys are\\n unremarkable.  The pancreas is unremarkable.  Visualized bone marrow is\\n normal.  Incidental note is made of a splenule in the left upper quadrant.\\n The prostate gland is moderately enlarged measuring 4.7 x 5.5 x 3.7 cm,\\n yielding a calculated prostate volume of 49.7 cm3.  The enlargement is\\n prominently in the central gland, but this is incompletely evaluated on this\\n study.',\n",

Local anesthesia was provided with 1% buffered\\n lidocaine.\\n\\n PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:\\n\\n An informed written consent was obtained after explaining the procedure,\\n benefits, alternatives and risks involved. The patient was brought to the\\n angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The upper abdomen\\n was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedure huddle and\\n timeout was performed as per [**Hospital1 51**] protocol.\\n\\n A scout image of the abdomen was obtained and stored. The stomach was\\n insufflated with air through the indwelling nasogastric tube. Under\\n fluoroscopy, the outline of the stomach and colon were noted. The liver edge\\n was was identified by percussion. Then under fluoroscopic guidance, three\\n T-fastener buttons were sequentially deployed elevating the stomach to the\\n anterior abdominal wall in a triangular fashion.\\n A small skin incision was made between the T-fastener buttons and an 18-gauge\\n needle was introduced into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance. The\\n position of the needle was confirmed with small amount of contrast injection.\\n The needle was removed over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 539**] wire and soft tissue tract dilated. Then a\\n 12 French Wills-[**Doctor Last Name 5929**] G-tube was placed over the wire. Guidewire was removed\\n and retaining loop of the catheter was formed in the stomach and locked after\\n confirming the position of the catheter by contrast injection.  The catheter\\n was flushed, capped and secured to the skin. Sterile dressings were applied.\\n The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate\\n complications.\",\n",
